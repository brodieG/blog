# Me

I am a hobbyist programmer based on the US east coast.  I am interested in data
analysis and visualization.  I program primarily in R, but have learned enough C
to understand the R internals and write the occasional R extension in C.  My
claim to fame is that I am a minor contributor to the R sources.
