It wasn't supposed to be this way.  You shouldn't be looking at drawing of a
[Lernean Hydra][51] laughing its ass off.  This post was going to be short,
sweet, and useful.  Instead it turned into a many-headed monster that is smugly
sitting on my chest smothering me.  What follows here is a retelling of my
flailing attempt at chopping off one of its heads.

It all started on a lark to see if I could make base R competitive with the
undisputed champ `data.table` [at computing group statistics][21].  That thought
alone is scoff-worthy enough that I deserve little sympathy for how
off-the-rails this whole thing has gone[^plight].

Let's skip back to the care-free, hydra-less days when I should have known
better:

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1106231241488154626")
```

"More on this next week"... &#x1f923;&#x1f923;&#x1f923;.  Aaaah, what a fool.
That was almost three months ago.  The key observations back then were that:

* `data.table` contributed its radix sort to R in R3.3.0, and as a result
* `order` became 50x faster under some work loads.

I was also alluding to something fairly remarkable that happens when you order
data before you process it.  Let's illustrate with 10MM items in ~1MM groups:
<span id=working-set></span>

```{r warning=FALSE}
RNGversion("3.5.2"); set.seed(42)
n     <- 1e7
n.grp <- 1e6
grp   <- sample(n.grp, n, replace=TRUE)
x     <- runif(n)
```
```{r sys-time, echo=FALSE}
sys.time <- function(exp, reps=11) {
  res <- matrix(0, reps, 5)
  time.call <- quote(system.time({NULL}))
  time.call[[2]][[2]] <- substitute(exp)
  gc()
  for(i in seq_len(reps)) {
    res[i,] <- eval(time.call, parent.frame())
  }
  structure(res, class='proc_time2')
}
print.proc_time2 <- function(x, ...) {
  print(
    structure(
      x[order(x[,3]),][floor(nrow(x)/2),],
      names=c("user.self", "sys.self", "elapsed", "user.child", "sys.child"),
      class='proc_time'
) ) }
```

The first step for computing group statistics is to split the data by group:

```{r eval=FALSE}
gs <- split(x, grp)
str(head(gs, 3))  # display structure of first 3 groups
```
```
List of 3
 $ 1: num [1:11] 0.216 0.537 0.849 0.847 0.347 ...
 $ 2: num [1:7] 0.0724 0.1365 0.5364 0.0517 0.1887 ...
 $ 3: num [1:7] 0.842 0.323 0.325 0.49 0.342 ...
```

`split` breaks up our vector `x` into a list of vectors defined by `grp`.  We
can see above the structure of the first three of these vectors.  This is a slow
step in group statistic computations, so lets time it with `sys.time` (a wrapper
around `system.time`[^sys-time]):

```{r eval=FALSE}
sys.time(gs <- split(x, grp))
```
```
   user  system elapsed
  5.643   0.056   5.704
```

Compare to what happens if we order the inputs first:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sys.time({
  o <- order(grp)
  xo <- x[o]
  go <- grp[o]
  gso <- split(xo, go)
})
```
```
   user  system elapsed
  1.973   0.060   2.054
```

Sorting values by group prior to running `split` makes it over twice as fast,
**including the time required to sort the data**.  We just doubled the speed of
an important workhorse R function without touching the code.  And we get the
exact same results:

```{r eval=FALSE}
identical(gs, gso)
```
```
[1] TRUE
```

Pixie dust.  `data.table` pixie dust.

# Latency Is The Enemy

_Something_ is going on underneath the hood that dramatically affects the
performance of the random scenario. The fundamental problem is that main
memory (RAM) access is laggy.  Over the past few decades CPU processing speed
has grown faster than memory latency has dropped.  Nowadays it may take ~200 CPU
cycles to have a CPU data request fulfilled from main memory.

Main memory latency is terrible, but thankfully its bandwidth has kept pace with
processor speeds.  A useful analogy is that of a long conveyor belt connecting a
storage warehouse (main memory) to its factory (CPU).  The first item requested
from the warehouse will be slow to arrive (latency), but if the conveyor belt is
loaded efficiently it will keep the factory fully supplied from the moment the
first item arrives (bandwidth).

This analogy can give us some idea of the type of problems caused by random
inputs.  Suppose the factory places a request for items from the warehouse,
taking care to order the items in the request form.  This is what the request
will look like mid-process, with processed items in yellow:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
strings <- sample(do.call(paste0, expand.grid(LETTERS, LETTERS)), 5)
strings.r <- strings.s <- matrix(sample(rep(strings, 4)), ncol=5)
strings.s[] <- sort(strings.s)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(strings.s))) cat(strings.s[i,], '\n')
for(i in seq_len(nrow(strings.r))) cat(strings.r[i,], '\n')
for(i in sample(unique(c(strings.s)))) cat(i, "[ ]\n")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
writeLines("

```

It takes time for the worker to change stations.  So long as packages are
requested repeatedly from the same station the worker can fully utilize the
conveyor belt.  As soon as they need to change stations, there will be a gap in
the conveyor belt corresponding to the time it takes to do so.  Unsurprisingly
when the items are requested randomly the ratio of package to gaps is worse:

```{r echo=FALSE}

                                   | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | â¬œ | ðŸ“¦
")
```

While this analogy only bears a passing resemblance to some parts of what
happens in the memory system, the concept applies generally.  Anytime you have
high latency and high bandwidth, predictable requests will utilize bandwidth
much better than unpredictable ones.

# Microarchitecture To The Rescue?

Chip designers have engaged in micro-architectural heroics to conceal main
memory latency.  Microarchitecture is _The Implementation Detail_.  Higher
level programs like C are compiled into [machine instructions][99].  In simpler
times, machines would just follow those instructions.  Nowadays a CPU only
pretends to do that.  "Behind the scenes" out of sight of the program it
re-interprets them in whatever way it sees fit[^assembly-is-to-c].  The key
constraint is that the CPU state visible to the program must be consistent with
the instructions, but that leaves room for some hair raising optimizations.
Everything that happens "behind the scenes" is the microarchitecture.

There are two main classes of microarchitectural tricks used to mask main
memory latency.  <span id=second-trick></span>The first one involves
interpreting instructions in such a way that the conveyor belt can be kept fully
utilized (i.e. few gaps) after the first item is requested.  This includes
preloading memory areas the CPU is likely to need based on prior access
patterns, executing operations out-of-order so that memory requests for later
operations are initiated while earlier ones wait for theirs to be fulfilled,
speculating at which conditional branch will be executed before its condition is
known so that out-of-order execution can continue past the branch, and other
optimizations.

The second involves having some amount of low latency memory known as cache.  In
our conveyor belt analogy it might be a shelf next to the assembly station with
room for a few items.  When items can be retrieved from cache we are insulated
from main memory latency.  Cache is very limited because it requires a more
expensive design _and_ it must be close to the CPU, typically on the exclusive
real estate of the CPU die:

<a href='#image-credits' title='Click for image credits.' class=image-credit>

/></a>
<figcaption>Half of a Westmere 6 Core Xeon Die</figcaption>
</figure>

We can see three levels of cache labeled L1, L2, and L3[^cache-labels], with the
first two inside the cores, and the last shared across all cores.  Each core
will have its own L1 and L2 cache, though we only label them within one core.
L1 cache is split between data cache (L1d) and instruction cache (L1i).  You can
get a sense of how different cache and main memory are by looking at the bigger
picture.  Main memory is on a different continent:

/>
</a>
<figcaption>Close-up of motherboard and CPU</figcaption>
</figure>

In many cases the combination of these tricks is sufficient to conceal or at
least amortize the latency over many accesses, but there are pathological
memory access patterns that defeat them.  `split`ting the randomly ordered
vector is an example of this.  [`treeprof`][22] gives us detailed timings for
the random and sorted `split` calls[^treeprof-manip]: <span id=split-times></span>

```{r echo=FALSE}
string <- "times in milliseconds
                                         random  |      sorted

    split.default --------------- : 7239 - \033[43m1997\033[m  |  1573 - \033[43m137\033[m
        as.factor --------------- : 5242 - 2471  |  1436 - 630
            sort ---------------- : 2771 -    0  |   806 -   0
                unique.default -- : 2705 - 2705  |   789 - 789
                sort.default ---- :   67 -    0  |    17 -   0
                    sort.int ---- :   67 -   27  |    17 -   7
                        order --- :   40 -   40  |     9 -   9"
writeLines(string)
```

There are many differences between the two runs, but let's focus on the
highlighted numbers to start.  These correspond to the internal C code that
scans through the input vector and the normalized group vectors[^proc-group],
and copies each input value into the result vector indicated by the
group[^split-internal].  The code will take the same exact number of steps
irrespective of input order, yet there is a ~15x speed-up between the sorted
(137ms) and randomized versions (1,997ms).

# Modelling Cache Effects

Ideally we would keep our whole working set in cache and not have to worry about
main memory latency.  Unfortunately the working set is often larger than cache.
We're interested in exploring how cache and working set size affect the speed of
the `split.default` calculation.

My system has a three level cache hierarchy as in the [pictured
die](#cpu-die)[^l1-data-vs-inst].  Each level is larger but slower than the
previous one[^mem-latency]:

```{r cache-access-model, echo=FALSE}
test.sizes <- c(9:25)
access.times <- c(4, 14, 40, 250)
mem.sizes <- c(L1=15, L2=18, L3=22, Main=33)

cache_times <- function(set.sizes, mem.sizes, access.times) {
  hit.rates <- outer(
    set.sizes, mem.sizes, function(x, y) 1 - pmax(0, x - y) / x
  )
  times <- matrix(numeric(), nrow=nrow(hit.rates), ncol=ncol(hit.rates))
  mult <- rep(1, nrow(hit.rates))
  for(i in seq_len(ncol(hit.rates))) {
    times[,i] <- hit.rates[,i] * access.times[i] * mult
    mult <- mult * (1 - hit.rates[,i])
  }
  times
}
### Two randomly accessed data sets, the result vector (numeric),
### and the offset vector, integer, and roughly a tenth of the size of the
### result vector since there is one offset per group

set.sizes.1 <- setNames(2^test.sizes * 8, test.sizes)
set.sizes.2 <- setNames(2^test.sizes * 4 / 10, test.sizes)

times1 <- cache_times(set.sizes.1, 2^mem.sizes, access.times)
times2 <- cache_times(set.sizes.2, 2^mem.sizes, access.times)
times <- rowSums(times1) + rowSums(times2)
```
```{r cache-sizes-and-speeds, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, out.width='45%', echo=FALSE, out.extra="style='display: inline;'"}
labels <- c('L1', 'L2', 'L3', 'Main')
 # access.times <- c(3, 15, 40, 250)
access.times <- c(4, 14, 40, 250)
sizes <- c(2^15, 2^18, 2^21, 2^33)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(labels=labels, cycles=access.times), aes(labels, cycles)) +
  geom_col() + xlab(NULL) +
  geom_label(aes(label=access.times), vjust=-.25) +
  ylab('Access Time (CPU Cycles)') +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0.05, 0.15)))
ggplot(data.frame(labels=labels, sizes=sizes/2^20), aes(labels, sizes)) +
  geom_col(color='grey35') +
  geom_col() +
  ylab('Memory Size (MB)') + xlab(NULL) +
  geom_label(
    aes(
      label=c('32KB', '256KB', '2MB', '8GB^^'),
      y=c(head(sizes, -1), 290)
    ), vjust=-.25
  ) +
  # expand doesn't work with ylim
  # scale_y_continuous(expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0.05, 0.10)))
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 300*1.1/1.05))
  # coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,2^4))
```

On a CPU clocked at 1.2GHz like mine a 4 cycle L1 access will take ~3.3ns
and a 250 cycle main memory access will take ~200ns.

One way to explore the cache effects is to build a model of what we think memory
access times should be based on working set size and the above data.  If cache
is effective we would expect processing times to follow our model.  We show our
[current working set](#working-set) size (10MM elements) as a vertical dashed
line[^working-set-size], the modeled access times as colored lines, and observed
timings as dots:

<span id=anomaly></span>Outside of a few anomalies[^model-anomalies] the model
works remarkably well.  It predicts a ~13x slowdown in the random vs. sorted
case for the 10MM element working set, which is close to the [observed
~15x](#split-times).  It is reasonably accurate for most other working set
sizes.

`split.default` has six memory accesses[^split-ops] per element
processed[^access-dominates].  When the inputs are ordered all of them are
sequential.  When they are not two of those are no longer sequential.

Sequential access are simple and predictable, and as a result memory systems
have built-in optimizations for them such as prefetching[^prefetch] and stream
buffers[^streams] (these are both forms of speculative execution[^spec-exec]).
We assume sequential accesses can be met at L1 cache speeds without consuming
cache.  Conversely random accesses do not benefit from these optimizations.   We
assume they are subject to the full memory system latency, the magnitude of
which will vary depending on how much of the working set fits in each level of
cache.  Transitions to a slower level of memory manifest as an increase in
per-element time that asymptotically[^asymptotic-latency] approaches the slower
memory's latency[^access-anomaly].

The implementation of this cache model is [available in the
appendix](#cache-model).

Since we are only modeling cache effects and the timings line up so closely,
this implies that there are no other optimizations for random accesses in
effect[^model-caveat].  Cache does mitigate the cost of random accesses, but
its effect quickly dissipates as working set size increases.

# Degrees of Pathology

We now have a reasonable understanding of why `split.default` works much faster
with ordered than unordered input.  What is not explained is why the combination
of ordering the inputs and splitting them is faster than splitting them
directly.  After all the ordering process itself involves random memory
accesses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
o <- order(grp)
go <- grp[o]            # random access
xo <- x[o]              # random access
split.default(xo, go)   # sequential
```

Even ignoring the `order` call, the indexing steps required to order `x` and
`grp` into `xo` and `go` are random accesses.  I ran the timings for `x[o]`
as well as for a version with `x` and `o` pre-sorted, and superimposed them with
a cache-only model for those accesses:

```{r subset-model, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
test.sizes <- 12:30 - 3
set.sizes <- setNames(2^test.sizes * 8, test.sizes)

times <- rowSums(cache_times(set.sizes, mem.sizes, access.times))

mdl.dat <- data.frame(
  x=log2(rep(set.sizes, 2)),
  y=log2(c(times + 2*4, rep(3 * 4, length(times)))),
  variable=rep(c('random', 'sorted'), each=length(times)),
  shape='Single'
)
resdfm <- proc_times(readRDS(sprintf(base, '-4')))
ymax <- max(resdfm$time.per, 2^mdl.dat$y)
cache.sizes.new <- c(head(cache.sizes, -1), log2(8*1e7))
dat.label <- as.data.frame(
  c(
    values=lapply(log2(ymax), rep, each=length(cache.sizes)),
    list(size=unname(cache.sizes.new)),
    list(label=cache.lab), list(style=cache.styles)
) )
resdfmm <- time_med(resdfm)

ggplot(
  resdfm,
  aes(
    x=log2(n * 8), y=log2(time.per),
    color=variable, shape=shape, fill=variable
  )
  #aes(x=log2(n * (8 + 4/10)), y=log2(time.per), color=variable, shape=shape)
) +
  geom_quasirandom(position='dodge', alpha=0.20) +
  extra +
  geom_text(
    data=dat.label,
    aes(
      x=size - .125, y=values, label=label, color=NULL, group=NULL,
      shape=NULL, fill=NULL
    ),
    color='black', hjust=1
  ) +
  geom_line(data=mdl.dat, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(data=resdfmm, size=3) +
  geom_vline(data=NULL, xintercept=cache.sizes.new, linetype=cache.styles)
```

There are many interesting things going on[^subset-order], but the most notable
one is that the random case substantially outperforms the corresponding
cache-only model.

Let's examine what the [subset C code][31] is doing, shown here in pseudo R
guise:
<span id=subset-pseudo></span>
```{r eval=FALSE}
res <- numeric(length(grp))
seqi <- seq_along(grp)
for(i in seqi) {
  val <- x[i]        # sequential - fetch x value to copy
  idx <- o[i]        # sequential - fetch write offset
  res[idx] <- val    # random - write x value at offset
}
```

The slow step is `res[idx] <- val` as `idx` can point to any location in the
result vector.  But the nice thing about this loop is that each iteration is
independent of all others.  This allows the processor to begin execution of
multiple loop iterations without waiting for the first one to complete, i.e.
out-of-order.

Out-of-order instructions are kept "in-flight" in the reorder buffer[^rob], an
on-die memory structure that can store a number of both pending and complete
instructions.  The purpose of the buffer is to allow instructions to be executed
out-of-order, but have their results committed in logical program order.
Once a result is committed it becomes part of the CPU state visible to the
program.

Let's pretend our system's reorder buffer supports up to eight "instructions"
"in-flight".  We can recast the first two iterations of the [previous `for`
loop](#pseudo-random) into the following instructions pseudo R code
instructions[^uops]:<span id=linear-ops></span>

```{r eval=FALSE}
## loop iteration 1
i1        <- seqi[1]               # PENDING
val1      <- x[i1]                 # PENDING
idx1      <- o[i1]                 # PENDING
res[idx1] <- val1                  # PENDING
## loop iteration 2
i2        <- seqi[2]               # PENDING
val2      <- x[i2]                 # PENDING
idx2      <- o[i2]                 # PENDING
res[idx2] <- val2                  # PENDING
```

We renamed the `i`, `val`, and `idx` variables by appending the loop number to
each of them[^tomasulo].  This allows the CPU to re-order them without
instructions from later iterations overwriting earlier ones.  They can now be
executed in the following order:

```{r eval=FALSE}
i1        <- seqi[1]               # PENDING
i2        <- seqi[2]               # PENDING

val1      <- x[i1]                 # PENDING
val2      <- x[i2]                 # PENDING

idx1      <- o[i1]                 # PENDING
idx2      <- o[i2]                 # PENDING

res[idx1] <- val1                  # PENDING
res[idx2] <- val2                  # PENDING
```

The processor is free to chose any instruction to execute that does not depend
on others.  In this case both the `i1` and `i2` instructions are eligible, so
the processor could execute one, the other, or even both
simultaneously[^simulataneous-ops].  Shortly after the first main memory access
is complete this will be the state:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## i1     <- seqi[1]               # retired
i2        <- seqi[2]               # complete
i3        <- seqi[3]               # PENDING

val1      <- x[i1]                 # PENDING
val2      <- x[i2]                 # PENDING

idx1      <- o[i1]                 # PENDING
idx2      <- o[i2]                 # PENDING

res[idx1] <- val1                  # PENDING
res[idx2] <- val2                  # PENDING
```

`i1`, and `i2` are both computed.  Additionally, the `i1` instruction is retired,
meaning its result is visible to the program and it no longer occupies one of
the eight "in-flight" slots.  The `i2` instruction cannot be retired despite
being complete because in the logical flow of the program it comes after the
`val1`, `idx1`, and `res[idx1]` commands that are still pending.  The `i3`
instruction takes up the slot freed by the retirement of the `i1` instruction.

The same dynamic will play out for the `val*` and `idx*` steps, which will lead
to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## i1     <- seqi[1]               # retired
## val1   <-   x[i1]               # retired
## idx1   <-   o[i1]               # retired

i2        <- seqi[2]               # complete
i3        <- seqi[3]               # complete

val2      <- x[i2]                 # complete
val3      <- x[i3]                 # complete

idx2      <- o[i2]                 # complete
idx3      <- o[i3]                 # complete

res[idx1] <- val1                  # PENDING
res[idx2] <- val2                  # PENDING
```

This is where out-of-order execution really shines.  All prior memory accesses
are sequential, so executing out-of-order is of marginal value as subsequent
reads would be fast anyway.  But the writes to `res` are random and
subject to the full memory latency.  Out-of-order execution allows us to run
them both concurrently.  This is of value because main memory has substantial
parallelism built-in[^mem-parallelism], i.e. the warehouse has multiple workers
available to load (or unload) the conveyor belt.  Processing speed for this type
of access will grow with the degree of main memory parallelism and the size of
the "in-flight" instruction window[^mem-parallel-caveat].

One way to confirm that out-of-order execution is in play is to prevent
it in an otherwise similar workload by adding a sequential loop dependency. We
can use "chasing indices" like this one:

<img
  src= "/post/2019-05-17-pixie-dust_files/user-imgs/index-chasing.png"
  class='aligncenter'
/>

Each vector element contains in it the (0-based) index of the next element to
visit.  The arrows illustrate the path that results from following the indices.
Unfortunately it isn't possible to do this efficiently in pure R code, so
instead I wrote a [C function to do it](#index-chasing), and superimposed its
timings on the previous ones as the  blue `random2` data set:

```{r dependency-model, echo=FALSE}
resdfm2 <- proc_times(readRDS(sprintf(base, '-13')))
 # resdfm2 <- proc_times(readRDS(sprintf(base, '-8')))
resdfm3 <- rbind(
  resdfm,
  transform(subset(resdfm2, variable=='random'), variable='random2')
)
ymax <- max(resdfm3$time.per, 2^mdl.dat$y)
dat.label <- as.data.frame(
  c(
    values=lapply(log2(ymax), rep, each=length(cache.sizes.new)),
    list(size=unname(cache.sizes.new)),
    list(label=cache.lab), list(style=cache.styles)
) )
resdfmm <- time_med(resdfm3)

ggplot(
  resdfm3,
  aes(
    x=log2(n * 8), y=log2(time.per),
    color=variable, shape=shape, fill=variable
  )
  #aes(x=log2(n * (8 + 4/10)), y=log2(time.per), color=variable, shape=shape)
) +
  geom_quasirandom(position='dodge', alpha=0.20) +
  extra +
  geom_text(
    data=dat.label,
    aes(
      x=size - .125, y=values, label=label, color=NULL, group=NULL,
      shape=NULL, fill=NULL
    ),
    color='black', hjust=1
  ) +
  geom_line(data=mdl.dat, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(data=subset(resdfmm, !is.na(time.per)), size=3) +
  geom_vline(data=NULL, xintercept=cache.sizes.new, linetype=cache.styles)
```

With the sequential dependency timings are back in line with the theoretical
cache-only model, demonstrating that the random subset likely benefited from
out-of-order execution.

Sure enough, it turns out that the `split.default` code has a sequential
dependency in it too: it uses an offset vector to track where in each group
vector to write the next value, and this vector is updated in the
loop[^loop-dep].

Random accesses are pathological to modern memory systems, but those with
sequential dependencies are downright killer.  When we order our input vectors
first we isolate random accesses to simple operations without sequential
dependencies and give the memory system the best chance to mitigate latency.

# Branch Prediction

One optimization we glossed over is branch prediction.  An out-of-order CPU
cannot put instructions "in-flight" past a branch (e.g. `if` statement) that
depends on incomplete previous instructions because it does not know which side
of the branch to put "in-flight".  Modern CPUs will make an educated guess and
speculate about which instructions to put "in-flight" so it can maintain the
benefits of out-of-order execution when it guesses right.

Ironically the key feature of branch predicting CPUs is not the ability to
guess, but rather the ability to recover from an incorrect guess.  The reorder
buffer assists in this by marking all "in-flight" operations predicated on
a branch guess as speculative.  These may then be discarded if the guess is
discovered to be incorrect when the branch condition computation completes.
Mispredictions do have a cost (15-20 cycles on my system[^bp-penalty]), so CPU
designers invest a substantial amount of effort to improve branch prediction.

Branch prediction likely only plays a minor role in our examples[^bp-minor];
however, for completeness sake I've contrived a new one that demonstrates its
effect.  Compilers are notoriously aggressive at removing branches, so for
controlled testing I wrote a toy example in C and compiled it with all
**optimizations turned off** (`-O0`)<span id=add_walk></span>:

```{c eval=FALSE}
SEXP add_walk2(SEXP x) {
  R_xlen_t size = XLENGTH(x);
  int *x_ptr=INTEGER(x);
  int accum = 0;

  for(R_xlen_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    if(*x_ptr > 0) {accum++;} else {accum--;}  // BRANCH
    ++x_ptr;
  }
  return ScalarInteger(accum);
}
```

This function computes the sum of a logical vector interpreting TRUE values as
`+1` and FALSE values as `-1`.  We can test it with logical vectors with
varying proportions of TRUE values, both random and sorted:

```{r branch-pred-model, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
res2 <- readRDS(sprintf(base, '-12'))
resdfm <- proc_times(res2)
resdfm <- transform(resdfm, time.per=time.per/1e7)
fracs <- sort(unique(resdfm[['fraction']]))
min.time <- median(subset(resdfm, fraction == 0)[['time.per']])
mdldf <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    fraction=fracs, time.per=min.time + pmin(fracs, 1-fracs) * 15,
    variable='random'
  ),
  data.frame(fraction=fracs, time.per=min.time, variable='sorted')
)
ggplot(
  resdfm,
  aes(x=fraction, y=time.per, color=variable, fill=variable)
  #aes(x=log2(n * (8 + 4/10)), y=log2(time.per), color=variable, shape=shape)
) +
  geom_quasirandom(position='dodge', alpha=0.20) +
  geom_line(data=mdldf) +
  extra +
  scale_y_continuous(label=identity) +
  scale_x_continuous(label=identity) +
  xlab("Fraction TRUE") +
  ylab("CPU Cycles Per Item") +
  ggtitle("add_walk timings with 1e7 logical input")
```

The colored branch misprediction penalty model lines use 15 cycles penalty per
misprediction, which fits the observed timings well.  In the randomly ordered
case the branch predictor cannot do better than predicting the higher frequency
branch on average.  In the sorted case there is essentially no misprediction
penalty as predicting recently seen branch directions is a good strategy.

A 15-20 cycle misprediction penalty is likely a best case scenario.  If the
mispredictions interfered with main memory accesses instead of register-only
operations as above, the cost would be much higher.

<figcaption>Meltdown, Specter, MDS, and Foreshadow, clockwise.</figcaption>
</figure>

So much ingenuity has gone into designing and implementing modern memory
systems that it's easy to forget the whole thing is a massive hack.
Case in point: a raft of severe processor security vulnerabilities published
over the past two years that exploit micro-architectural optimizations.

The limitations of the microarchitecture expose its supposedly hidden
implementation details to probing via observation of timings.  The expense of
the silicon that implements it has led to it being shared concurrently across
processes.  The combination of these makes for a horror show of severe and
difficult to fix vulnerabilities.

[MDS][82] (bottom-right in inset) was announced while I was in the process of
writing this post, about sixteen months after the [Meltdown][83] and
[Spectre][84] vulnerabilities were disclosed (top row).  What's staggering is
that changes that Intel introduced to its newest processors to mitigate Meltdown
have made some of the MDS vulnerabilities worse.

My little seguÃ« here has little relevance to the post other than
microarchitecture is involved and the timing of the disclosures of the most
recent vulnerabilities.  If you have been reading the headlines over the past
year or so and have wondered exactly what this was all about, I encourage you to
read the papers.  They are remarkably accessible, and occasionally [downright
funny][86].

# Loose Ends

The internal code in `split.default` had the largest proportional difference
between sorted and unsorted cases, but both `as.factor` and `unique.default`
together account for a larger part of the overall difference:

```{r echo=FALSE}
string <- "times in milliseconds
                                         random  |      sorted
split --------------------------- : 7239 -    0  |  1573 -   0
    split.default --------------- : 7239 - 1997  |  1573 - 137
        as.factor --------------- : 5242 - \033[43m2471\033[m  |  1436 - \033[43m630\033[m
            sort ---------------- : 2771 -    0  |   806 -   0
                unique.default -- : 2705 - \033[43m2705\033[m  |   789 - \033[43m789\033[m
                sort.default ---- :   67 -    0  |    17 -   0
                    sort.int ---- :   67 -   27  |    17 -   7
                        order --- :   40 -   40  |     9 -   9"
writeLines(string)
```

These are the steps that turn the groups into factor levels so they can be used
as offsets into the result vector for `split.default`.  Both of them rely on
[hash tables][2]: `unique` uses one to detect whether [a value is
duplicated][61], and [`as.factor` uses one][63] via [`match` to assign a unique
index][62] to each distinct value in its input.

Why is the sorting effect less pronounced with these?  Most likely because
hashing by its nature undoes some of the benefits of the sort.  In R, hash
tables are stored as vectors twice the size of the vector being
hashed[^hash-tables-in-r].  So in `unique.default(grp)`, we are generating a
hash table with **twenty million** elements, of which we will eventually use
~one million[^one-million].  Worse, from a memory system perspective, the
hashing function will try to distribute the values evenly [and randomly][64]
throughout the hash vector.  Nothing like large memory allocations accessed
randomly to make the memory system happy.

Sorting the data still helps because for each group the same hash key will be
accessed repeatedly such that only the first access for each group is subjected
to the full main memory latency, other optimizations notwithstanding.

One last thing to point out: we ordered our vectors once, but we reaped the
micro-architectural benefits in three different places.  This in part explains
how we get so much of a performance improvement even when we account for the
time it takes to order the data.

<!-- Notes on Hash Tables in R - For Integers

Haven't thought too hard about distinctions between long vs not long

They are sized to be the closest power of 2 that is larger than twice the
length of the input vector.

https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/tags/R-3-5-3/src/main/unique.c#L355

Do I have this right?  This is insane if that's the case, as we can just create
a vector that size and use the vector values as offsets?  Ah, no, because the
vector value could be e.g. 2^31 - 1 in a vector of length 1000.

One of the mindblowing things is that the hash table is self overlapping.  This
allows the hash table to be a single integer vector instead of a list of cons
cells.  It does lead to the odd situation that if you hit a hash code for the
first time that spot may be occupied from a previous overflow.

-->

# Conclusions

The irony in all this is that the micro-architectural mess we just slogged
through is a side-show.  The principal reason I care about ordering data is that
it opens up possibilities for different and more efficient processing
algorithms, independent of micro-architectural factors.  It's just that when I
ran into such an in-your-face manifestation of them  I could not resist
exploring.

Stay tuned for Part II of the Hydra Chronicles, in which we will explore how
ordered data can do amazing things.  Originally I was planning on ending the
post with the hydra drawing minus a couple of heads, but its grown on me and I
feel bad doing that.  Henceforth it will be a mascot and the name of this series
of blog posts, and it won't make any sense except to those like you that read
the first one.  That's okay, it will be our inside joke.

## Function Definitions

### sys.time

Please note there is an error in this function.  When `reps` is odd, it returns
the timing of the run just faster than the median run.  Since all timings were
taken with this error in effect, they should still be comparable.

```{r sys-time, eval=FALSE}
```

### Cache Model

The implementation of the cache model for the random accesses for
`split.default`.

```{r cache-access-model, eval=FALSE}
```

### Index Chasing

Simulate a pointer chasing chain by generating indices that reference the next
index to go to.  We make the index a numeric rather than an integer just to
match working set sizes we used in other examples.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rand_path <- function(size) {
  if(!is.numeric(size) || length(size) != 1 || is.na(size) || size < 1)
    stop("bad input size")
  idx <- sample(as.integer(size - 1L)) + 1
  res <- numeric(size)
  res[c(1, head(idx, -1))] <- idx
  res[tail(idx, 1)] <- 1
  res - 1
}
```

We can then "walk" these indices with some C code that writes the index values
to a new vector in the order of the walk.  This is not exactly equivalent
to indexing a vector in random order, but the number of random memory accesses
is the same and that is the limiting element.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## CAREFUL: `x` should only be as produced by `rand_path`
walkrand <- inline::cfunction(
  sig=c(x='numeric'),
  body="
  R_xlen_t len = XLENGTH(x);
  double *x_ptr = REAL(x);
  SEXP res = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, len));
  double *resvec = REAL(res);
  R_xlen_t idx = 0;

  for(R_xlen_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
    idx = x_ptr[idx];
    resvec[i] = idx;
  }
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return res;
")
```

### Branch Prediction

The function is in the [body of the post](#add_walk), but due to the need to
compile it with optimizations turned off I had to take special steps to use it.
First I temporarily updated `~/.R/Makevars`:

```
CFLAGS = -S -masm=intel -O0    // For disassembly
CFLAGS = -O0 -Wall -std=gnu99  // For assembly with no optimization
```

Then in an R session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tools::Rcmd('shlib add-walk2.c')
dyn.load('add-walk2.so')
.Call('add_walk2', sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1e7, rep=TRUE))
```

## Benchmarking Code

This ended up being a bit messy.  The code below runs the benchmarks and stores
the result as RDSes.  The code inline to the post loads the RDSes and displays
the data.

```{r eval=FALSE}

  # subsequent processing code relied on having sorted vs unsorted data, so
  # that's why we write the same value twice
  res <- append(
    res, list(
      normal=time.normal, sorted=time.normal, n=sizes[[idx]], times=times[idx]
  ) )
  print(time.normal)

  time.sorted <- sys.time(for(j in 1:10) .Call('add_walk2', vecss[[i]]))

  res <- append(

}
  # saveRDS(res, ...)
```

[^spec-exec]: Actions taken by the microarchitecture that anticipate
  instruction needs to take advantage of microarchitectural parallelism and
  mitigate latency.  These include branch prediction, prefetching, and similar.
  Although out-of-order execution is not strictly speculative, in modern systems
  in combination with branch prediction it becomes so anytime it starts
  executing instructions past speculated branches.
[^assembly-is-to-c]: Another way to think about it is that microarchitecture is
  to assembly instructions as a compiler is to a C program.  In both cases a
  process will interpret a set of instructions (C code, assembly) into a
  different lower-level set of instructions (assembly, CPU micro-operations).
  The processes must abide by constraints (a flavor of the C standard, an
  [Instruction Set Architecture][99]), but these are loose enough to allow
  outrageous re-interpretation.  There are few things quite as humbling as
  learning just enough assembly that you can look at the disassembly of what you
  thought was a simple C function and realize there is almost no relationship
  between what you wrote and what the program is doing other than the semantics
  are the same, assuming no unintended use of undefined behavior.  And then
  there is the whole microarchitectural layer on top of that.  Maybe once upon a
  time C was close to the metal, but nowadays writing in C to be close to the
  metal is like hanging out in the basement to be closer to the iron core of the
  planet.
[^plight]: The source of this post is nearing two thousand lines and I haven't
  even started addressing the question I set out to answer.
[^assembly]: Assembly instructions are low level commands that can be directly
  interpreted by the CPU.  Programs that are not written in assembly are
  translated into assembly directly by a compiler, or indirectly by mapping
  program instructions to pre-compiled assembly instructions.
[^bp-minor]: There are a few spots where branch prediction is likely happening.
  First in the loops proper as the break condition is a branch.  Since our
  loops are long, guessing that the loop will continue indefinitely is an easy
  and effective guess.  More importantly, our loops are dominated by the slow
  random access, so with out-of-order execution the all the other steps can be
  run quickly, including the loop condition calculation.  In this case the
  branch will not be the bottleneck and value of branch prediction is limited.
  Another place it comes in is checking that indices are not NA, and finally in
  the [type conditional in `split.default`][97].  However, as was the case
  earlier, the bottlenecks remain the random accesses even if branch prediction
  is successful.  For example, even if we successfully guess that the
  group-offset value is not NA, we cannot proceed until we get the offset value
  to write to the group vector.  Finally, it is entirely possible that some of
  the branches in question are being eliminated by the compiler and are not even
  in the assembly instructions issued to the processor.
[^subset-order]: With working set less than L1 in size, it looks like the system
  can execute all three memory accesses (two loads, one store) simultaneously.
  This is not entirely surprising given that my [Skylake processor][95] has two
  load data execution units and one store data execution unit.  After that point
  there is a penalty, which is eventually amortized for the sorted set.  Because
  it is amortized eventually this suggests its not a cache penalty.  It may be a
  TLB ([Translation Lookaside Buffer][29]) effect, although it seems too early
  for that to happen as the DTLB supports 64 4KB pages, and with a 32KB working
  set (`xo`), the total memory we're using is 32KB + 32KB + 16KB (`xo` + `x` +
  `o`).  The next jump at 64MB could be the same DTLB jump we [saw
  earlier](#anomaly).
[^one-million]: Even though we're only using one million elements from the hash
  table the cache effective size of it will be likely at least 8 times that as
  memory is always brought into cache in cache-line size, or 64 bytes.  In order
  to bring in one eight byte numeric value from the hashtable, we have to bring
  in another 56 bytes of mostly unused hash table around it.  In many cases it
  will be even worse as the hardware prefetcher may bring in two cache lines
  instead of just one.
[^bp-penalty]: Agner Fog lists 15-20 cycles for Haswell, Broadwell, and Skylake
  on [p29 of "The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs"][56].
[^tomasulo]: The 1965 [Tomasulo Paper][75] implicitly introduced the concept of
  register renaming that breaks the false dependency that exists when
  names/registers are re-used and allows increased instruction-level
  parallelism.
[^uops]: The eight instructions we show here will likely correspond to
  substantially more micro-operations, both because they are intended to
  symbolize assembler instructions and not micro-operations, and also because
  the actual C implementation of the R code is [more][31] [complex][60] than the
  pseudo code indicates.
[^hash-tables-in-r]: Hash tables used to take up 4x the size of the
  hashed input, but in [2004 that was switched to 2x][65].  A tidbit I found
  fascinating is that the R hash tables are [open-addressed][67], meaning that
  collisions are resolved by walking along the hash vector until an open slot is
  found instead of appending an element to the end of a linked list or similar.
  Additionally, it is the index into the vector that is hashed that is stored,
  no the value itself.  This means all vector types can have an integer hash
  table (or double if using LONG_VECTOR_SUPPORT, which nowadays is probably the
  default).
[^rob]: Assuming no sequential instruction dependencies, CPUs that can engage in
  out-of-order execution can get ahead by as many micro-operations as will fit
  in the re-order buffer.  Re-order buffer sizes vary by architecture.  On my
  Skylake system the reorder buffer supports 224 micro-operations ([Agner
  Fog][57], p149).  There are some further limitations on the types of
  quantities of any single type of operation in the re-order buffer.
[^mem-parallelism]: Main memory parallelism arises from it comprising multiple
  banks that can be accessed independently.  It is difficult to get information
  on exactly how many independently accessible banks my system has, but it
  seems likely to be at least 16.  So long as the random accesses are from
  different banks they should all be addressable concurrently.  [Anandtech][35]
  goes into some detail on memory banks.  See this [University of Utah CS7810
  presentation][32] for some discussion of the parallelism obtained from banks
  in DRAM memory, and the introduction to the [Wikipedia SDRAM page][33] which
  also mentions banks, interleaving, and pipelining.
[^model-caveat]: It is also possible the reality is more complicated and
  there are offsetting factors cancelling each other out.  I have no easy way of
  knowing that my inferences about what is happening are correct.  I'm relying
  exclusively on the simple model producing reasonable results, and common sense
  based on the information I have been able to gather.  Ideally I would be able
  to query performance counters to confirm that cache misses can indeed explain
  the observed timings, but those are hard to access on OS X, and even harder
  still for code that is run as part of R.  One element that is almost
  undoubtedly influencing performance is Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
  misses, which I do not model at all.
[^mem-latency]: The latency figures are approximate.  In particular, the main
  memory latency may be incorrect.  For cache we use the numbers provided in
  [Agner Fog's "The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs"][57].  For L3
  we picked a seemingly reasonable number in the provided range.
[^prefetch]: When a cache line is fetched, processors will often fetch the
  subsequent cache line as well.  This is called prefetching.
[^streams]: [Nima Honarmand's "Memory Prefetching"][28] lecture strongly suggests
  data streams can be supported without polluting cache (p13,21-22), that is
  without consuming much of the cache itself. Same with the [Paul Wicks "Miss
  Caches, Victim Caches and Stream Buffers" presentation][59] (p14-15). Both of
  them are based off of the [Jouppi paper][91].  The [June 2016
  iteration of the "Intel 64 and IA-32 Optimization Reference Manual"][93]
  references a "Streaming Prefetcher" a.k.a. "Data Cache Unit Prefetcher" (DCU)
  in section 2.3.5.4 and the "IP Prefetcher" that feed into L1, but their
  constraints suggest that it might not be the one doing the buffering.
  An older [version of the same manual][58] only mentions the L2 streamers
  (sections 2.1.5, 2.2.4, 3.7.3, 7.2, 7.6.3), stating that prefetches go into
  L2.  It is also not clear from the Intel docs that the streamers avoid
  cache pollution via e.g. a buffer.  [John McAlpin suggests][96] cache lines
  can be explicitly marked as LRU so they get evicted first; perhaps this is how
  pollution is avoided without a stream buffer.  My observations are consistent
  with streams being met at L1 speeds without cache pollution, although it could
  be due to other factors (e.g. accesses are met at L2 speeds, but multiple
  accesses are done simultaneously).
[^treeprof-manip]: I manually juxtaposed the output of two `treeprof` runs.
[^split-ops]: We are including only the operations used to process the inputs
  in the main loop.  These are: read input value (1), read factor level (2),
  fetch target vector from result list (3), read offset for target vector (4),
  write value to target vector at offset (5), and increment offset (6).
[^working-set-size]: We use for working set size the portion of the data that
  cannot be accessed sequentially when the input is randomized.  This is the
  size of the result list of vectors which will be a little over 10MM elements
  each 8 bytes in size, and the offset tracking vector which will be ~1MM
  elements, each 4 bytes in size.  In reality there is more data involved, but
  because the rest of it are accessed sequentially, their impact on cache
  utilization is much lower.  Additionally, because the offset tracking vector
  is so much smaller than the main result list we assume that it will not
  substantively alter the eviction rate of the larger result set, and it will
  also not be evicted as any part of it is likely to have been accessed more
  recently than the result set.
[^access-dominates]: There are a few other operations involved, such as
  allocating memory and incrementing offset counters, but these are a small
  portion of the overall time.
[^asymptotic-latency]: Keep in mind that the x-axis is log base 2, so each step
  corresponds to a doubling of the working set size.  After the first step past
  a cache level transition, only half the working set can be accessed from the
  faster cache.  After two only a quarter, and so on.
[^model-anomalies]: Two notable anomalies are (1) decreasing times per item for
  the smaller sets that are possibly a result of R function call overhead being
  amortized over an increasing number of entries, and (2) a jump up at largest
  working set sizes for sequential access that could correspond to the
  [Translation Lookaside Buffer][29] being exhausted.  This is a cache for
  translation of virtual to physical memory addresses.  The [Intel 64 and IA-32
  Optimization Reference Manual][58] notes in table 2-9 that there are 32 2/4MB
  DTLB entries, which would suggest a TLB walk after 64 or 128MB, around the
  point we see a timing anomaly.  We are being sloppy about accounting as the
  "working set" size we report is just the randomly accessed memory, but
  presumably the sequentially accessed memory must be mapped by the TLB as well.
[^access-anomaly]: There are only three transitions from faster to slower
  memory, yet there are four bumps in the plot.  This is because our working set
  contains two randomly accessed elements: the result list with the double
  precision vectors that correspond to each group, and an integer vector that
  tracks the offsets within each group that the next element will be written to.
  The last bump corresponds to the point at which the offset integer vector
  outgrows L3 cache.  With ten elements per group on average, we will need ~1
  million elements in the offset vector to track each group with a 10MM working
  set size.  At 4 bytes an element, that makes for a ~4MB integer vector, which
  is the size of L3 cache.
[^proc-group]: Prior to this step the group vector is turned into integer group
  numbers that match the offset into the result list that the values of a group
  will be stored in.
[^split-internal]: The timing corresponds to the [`.Internal` call that
  invokes][30] the [C code][25] that does the allocation of the result vector
  and the copying, although the bulk of the time is spent copying .   The
  `.Internal` call does not show up in the R profile data used to build the
  `treeprof` output because `.Internal` is both "special" (i.e.
  `typeof(.Internal) == "special"`, see `?Rprof`) _and_ a primitive.  "special"
  functions are those that can access their arguments unevaluated.
  See [R Internals][23] for details.
[^loop-dep]: `split` tracks the offset at which the next value in a group will be
  written to, and increments that offset each time a value is written.  In other
  words, in order to know where in the result vector a value needs to go, the
  CPU needs to know how many times previously that group was written to, which
  is difficult to do without a level of insight into the code the CPU is
  unlikely to have.
[^l1-data-vs-inst]: My system actually has 64KB of L1 cache, but it is split
  into 32KB of data cache (L1d), and 32KB of instruction cache (L1i).
[^sys-time]: It runs `system.time` eleven times and returns the median timing.
  It is [defined in the appendix](#sys.time).
[^cache-labels]: These are labeled on a best-efforts basis and may be incorrect.
[^mem-parallel-caveat]: This assumes the memory locations are in separate banks,
  which should be the case for most random accesses, although occasionally it
  won't be the case.
[^simulataneous-ops]: Almost all processors nowadays are [superscalar][77],
  meaning that they have multiple execution units that can compute
  simultaneously.  More recent processors can execute up to [eight
  micro-operations in parallel][72], although execution units are specialized so
  it is not possible to have eight arbitrary operations done in parallel.

Intel optimization manual

Trying to use this to bridge the line-fill buff vs stream buffer.  Section 2.1.5
discusses this, although it isn't clear what the level of cache pollution is,
and how L1 and L2 interact since stuff seems to be prefetched to L2, not L1.
This also doesn't exactly match the Honarmand model since:

"The streamer and spatial prefetcher prefetch the data to the last level cache.
Typi-cally data is brought also to the L2 unless the L2 cache is heavily loaded
with missing demand requests"

Figure 2-1 on page 42 does show the "Line Fill Buffers" to be between L2 and
L1d, and these are said to have 10 entries (cache line sized), and 20 for L2 (?).

Also, Table 2-9 on p58 has DTLB sizes for Sandy bridge (64 4KB entries, 32
2/4MB entries, 4 1 GB entries)

Aha, found it, see a more updated version of the manual (link #93)

John McCalpin who seems to now what he's talking about discusses concurrency
limits.

This is a very interesting thread.  Gets to the meat of how reorder buffer and
memory loads interact.

A few interesting points:

* On main mem latency:
    * 2.6GHZ has 85ns memory latency, which is ~220 cycles
    * For a single-socket system the latency may be as low as ~60 ns, so at
      3.0 GHz the latency would be about 180 cycles.
* L1d misses supported by line fill buffers, of which there are 10 on Sandy
  bridge, suspects same for skylake.
* If no miss there are way more buffers available (72 load, 42 store)
* To get more than 10 memory requests you need to go to L2 hardware prefetchers.

Several presentations that make clear the relationship between ROB and the
Tomasulo algorithm: in particular, the ROB allows the possibility of branch
speculation as we can toss everything in case of a misprediction or exception.
Exception was the original intent.  Second link is particularly useful.

The wiki entry suggests the re-order buffer existed originally.

Miss/Victim Cache, stream buffer.

<!--
A more update version of the intel optimization manual (we have an older one
linked as #58) clarifies the stream buffer issue:

Two hardware prefetchers load data to the L1 DCache:

* Data cache unit (DCU) prefetcher. This prefetcher, also known as the streaming
  prefetcher, is triggered by an ascending access to very recently loaded data.
  The processor assumes that this access is part of a streaming algorithm and
  automatically fetches the next line.
* Instruction pointer (IP)-based stride prefetcher. This prefetcher keeps track
  of individual load instructions. If a load instruction is detected to have a
  regular stride, then a prefetch is sent to the next address which is the sum
  of the current address and the stride. This prefetcher can prefetch forward or
  backward and can detect strides of up to 2K bytes

There are many constraints on these prefetches that suggests its likely the L2
streamers that are doing the real work (e.g. "The prefetched data is within the
same 4K byte page as the load instruction that triggered it").
