What do psychedelic triangles and chimeras have in common?  Oddly the answer is
"list data structures".  I discovered this while procrastinating from the side
project that was my procrastination from my actual projects.  Much
to my surprise, shading triangles from vertex colors is faster with list data
structures than with matrices and arrays.  This despite the calculations
involved being simple additions and multiplications on large atomic vectors.

As with everything in life there are caveats to this finding.  It is primarily
applicable to tall and skinny data sets, i.e. those with a very high ratio of
observations to variables.  It also requires some additional work over standard
methods.  Given that this type of data set is fairly common, it seems worth
showing methods for working with list data structures.  In my particular use
case I saw speed improvements on the order of 2x to 4x.

If you are bored easily you might want to skip straight to the [case
study](#a-case-study) section of this post.  If you like benchmarks and want an
extensive review of list data structure manipulations, read on.

# Matrices Are Slow?

## Column Subsetting

Generally speaking matrices are amongst the R data structures that are
fastest to operate on.  After all, they are contiguous chunks of memory with
almost no overhead.  Unfortunately, they do come with a major limitation: any
subset operation requires copying the data:

```{r}
set.seed(1023)
n <- 1e5

M <- cbind(runif(n), runif(n), runif(n), runif(n))
D <- as.data.frame(M)
microbenchmark(M[,1:2], D[,1:2], times=25)
```

The data frame subset is much faster because R treats data frame columns as
independent objects, so referencing an entire column does not require a copy.
But data frames have big performance problems of their own.  Let's see what
happens if we select columns **and** rows:

```{r}
idx <- sample(seq_len(nrow(M)), n/2)
microbenchmark(M[idx,1:2], D[idx,1:2], times=25)
```

And its even worse if we have duplicate row indices:

```{r}
idx2 <- c(idx, idx[1])
microbenchmark(M[idx2,1:2], D[idx2,1:2], times=25)
```

Data frames have row names that are required to be unique and most of the row
subsetting overhead comes from managing them.

## Lists to the Rescue

With a little extra work you can do most of what you would normally do with a
matrix or data frame with a list.  For example, to select "rows" in a list of
vectors, we use `lapply` to apply `[` to each component vector:

```{r}
L <- as.list(D)
str(L)
sub.L <- lapply(L[1:2], '[', idx)
str(sub.L)

col_eq(sub.L, D[idx,1:2])  # col_eq compares values column by column
```

This results in the same elements selected as with data frame or matrix
subsetting, except the result remains a list.  You can see how `col_eq` compares
objects in the [appendix](#col_eq).

Despite the explicit looping over columns this list based subsetting is
comparable to matrix subsetting in speed:

```{r}
microbenchmark(lapply(L[1:2], '[', idx), M[idx,1:2], D[idx,1:2], times=25)
```

And if we only index columns then the list is even faster than the data frame:

```{r}
microbenchmark(L[1:2], M[,1:2], D[,1:2], times=25)
```

# Patterns in List Based Analysis

## Row Subsetting

As we saw previously the idiom for subsetting "rows" from a list of equal length
vectors is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lapply(L, '[', idx)
```

The `lapply` expression is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
fun <- `[`
result <- vector("list", length(L))
for(i in seq_along(L)) result[[i]] <- fun(L[[i]], idx)
```

We use `lapply` to apply a function to each element of our list.  In our case,
each element is a vector, and the function is the subset operator `[`.  In R,
`L[[i]][idx]` and `'['(L[[i]], idx)` are equivalent as operators are really just
functions that R recognizes as functions at parse time.

## Column Operations

We can extend the `lapply` principle to other operators and functions.  To
multiply every column by two we can use:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix=  M * 2,
  List=    lapply(L, '*', 2)
)
```

This will work for any binary function.  For unary functions we just omit the
additional argument:

```{r eval=FALSE}
lapply(L, sqrt)
```

We can also extend this to column aggregating functions:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix_sum=  colSums(M),
  List_sum=    lapply(L, sum),
  Matrix_min=  apply(M, 2, min),
  List_min=    lapply(L, min)
)
```

In the matrix case we have the special `colSums` function that does all the
calculations in internal C code.  Despite that it is no faster than the list
approach.  And for operations without special column functions such as finding
the minimum by column we need to use `apply`, at which point the list approach
is much faster.

If we want to use different scalars for each column things get a bit more
complicated, particularly for the matrix approach.  The most natural way to do
this with the matrix is to transpose and take advantage of column recycling.
For lists we can use `Map`:

```{r}
vec <- 2:5
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix= t(t(M) * vec),
  List=   Map('*', L, vec)
)
col_eq(t(t(M) * vec), Map('*', L, vec))
```

`Map` is a close cousin of `mapply`. It calls its first argument, in this case
the function `*`, with one element each from the subsequent arguments, looping
through the argument elements.  We use `Map` instead of `mapply` because it is
guaranteed to always return a list, whereas `mapply` will simplify the result to
a matrix.  It is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
f <- `*`
result <- vector('list', length(vec))
for(i in seq_along(L)) result[[i]] <- f(L[[i]], vec[[i]])
```

There are some faster ways to do this with matrices, such as:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix=  M %*% diag(vec),
  List=    Map('*', L, vec)
)
col_eq(M %*% diag(vec), Map('*', L, vec))
```

But even that is slower than the list approach, with the additional infirmities
that it cannot be extended to other operators, and it works incorrectly if the
data contains infinite values.

`Map` also allows us to operate pairwise on columns.  Another way to compute the
square of our data might be:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix= M * M,
  List=   Map('*', L, L)
)
col_eq(M * M, Map('*', L, L))
```

## Row-wise Operations

A classic row-wise operation is to sum values by row.  This is easily done with
`rowSums` for matrices.  For lists, we can use `Reduce` to collapse every column
into one:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  Matrix= rowSums(M),
  List=   Reduce('+', L)
)
col_eq(rowSums(M), Reduce('+', L))
```

Much to my surprise `Reduce` is substantially faster, despite explicitly looping
through the columns.  From informal testing `Reduce` has an edge up to ten
columns or so.  This may be because `rowSums` will use `long double` to store
the interim results of the row sums, whereas `+` will just add double values
directly, with some loss of precision as a result.

`Reduce` collapses the elements of the input list by repeatedly applying a
binary function to turn two list elements into one.  `Reduce` is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
result <- numeric(length(L[[1]]))
for(l in L) result <- result + l
```

An additional advantage of the `Reduce` approach is you can use any binary
function for the row-wise aggregation.

## List to Matrix and Back

R is awesome because it adopts some of the better features of functional
languages and list based languages.  For example, the following two statements
are equivalent:

```{r}
ML1 <- cbind(x1=L[[1]], y1=L[[2]], x2=L[[3]], y2=L[[4]])
ML2 <- do.call(cbind, L)
```

Proof:

```{r}
col_eq(ML1, ML2)
col_eq(ML1, M)
```

The blurring of calls, lists, data, and functions allows for very powerful
manipulations of list based data.  In this case, `do.call(cbind, LIST)` will
transform any list containing equal length vectors into a matrix, irrespective
of how many columns it has.

To go in the other direction:

```{r}
LM <- lapply(seq_len(ncol(M)), function(x) M[,x])
col_eq(L, LM)
```

You _could_ use `split` but it is much slower.

## More on `do.call`

List based analysis works particularly well with `do.call` and functions that
use `...` parameters:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  List=   do.call(pmin, L),
  Matrix= pmin(M[,1],M[,2],M[,3],M[,4])
)
```

The expression is both easier to type, and faster!

There are a couple of "gotchas" with `do.call`, but they only crop up if you try
to pass quoted language as part of the argument list (e.g. `quote(a + b)`).  If
you are just using normal R data objects then the one drawback that I am
aware of is that the call stack can get messy if you ever invoke `traceback()`
or `sys.calls()` from a function called by `do.call`.

Remember that data frames are lists, so you can do things like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do.call(pmin, iris[-5])
```

## High Dimensional Data

Matrices naturally extend to arrays in high dimensional data.  Imagine we wish
to track triangle vertex coordinates in 3D space.  We can easily set up an array
structure to do this:

```{r}
verts <- 3
dims <- 3
V <- runif(n * verts * dims)
tri.A <- array(
  V, c(n, verts, dims),
  dimnames=list(NULL, vertex=paste0('v', seq_len(verts)), dim=c('x','y','z'))
)
tri.A[1:2,,]
```

How do we do this with lists?  Well, it turns out that you can make
list-matrices and list-arrays.  First we need to manipulate our data little as
we created it originally for use with an array:

```{r}
MV <- matrix(V, nrow=n)
tri.L <- lapply(seq_len(verts * dims), function(x) MV[,x])
```

Then, we just add dimensions:

```{r}
dim(tri.L) <- tail(dim(tri.A), -1)
dimnames(tri.L) <- tail(dimnames(tri.A), -1)
tri.L
class(tri.L)
typeof(tri.L)
```

A chimera! `tri.L` is a list-matrix.  While this may seem strange if you haven't
come across one previously, the list matrix and 3D array are essentially
equivalent:

```{r}
head(tri.A[,'v1','x'])
head(tri.L[['v1','x']])
```

An example operation might be to find the mean value of each coordinate for each
vertex:

```{r}
colMeans(tri.A)
apply(tri.L, 1:2, do.call, what=mean)
```

`apply` with the second argument set to `1:2` is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
MARGIN <- 1:2
result <- vector('list', prod(dim(tri.L)[MARGIN]))
dim(result) <- dim(tri.L)[MARGIN]
fun <- do.call
for(i in seq_len(nrow(tri.L)))
  for(j in seq_len(ncol(tri.L)))
    result[i, j] <- fun(what=mean, tri.L[i, j])
```

We use `do.call` because `tri.L[i, j]` is a list, and we wish to call `mean`
with the contents of the list, not the list itself.  We could also have used a
function like `function(x) mean(x[[1]])` instead of `do.call`.

We'll be using list matrices in the next section.

# A Case Study

One of my side projects required me to implement [barycentric coordinate][1]
conversions.  You can think of barycentric coordinates of a point in a triangle
as the weights of the vertices that cause the triangle to balance on that
point.

We show here three different points (red crosses) with the barycentric
coordinates associated with each vertex.  The size of the vertex helps visualize
the "weights":

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
plot_par()
plot_bary(p1, vinit)
plot_bary(p2, vinit)
plot_bary(p3, vinit)
```

This is useful if we want to interpolate values from the vertices to points in
the triangle.  Here we interpolate a color for a point in a triangle from the
colors of the vertices of that triangle:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
plot_par()
plot_bary2(p1, vinit)
plot_bary2(p2, vinit)
plot_bary2(p3, vinit)
```

<a name='bary_formula'></a>The formula for converting cartesian coordinates [to Barycentric][1] is:

$$\lambda_1 = \frac{(y_2 - y_3)(x - x_3) + (x_3 - x_2)(y - y_3)}{(y_2 - y_3)(x_1 - x_3) + (x_3 - x_2)(y_1 - y_3)}\\
\lambda_2 = \frac{(y_3 - y_1)(x - x_3) + (x_1 - x_3)(y - y_3)}{(y_2 - y_3)(x_1 - x_3) + (x_3 - x_2)(y_1 - y_3)}\\
\lambda_3 = 1 - \lambda_1 - \lambda_2$$

You can see that whatever the data structure is, we will be using a lot of
column subsetting for this calculation.  We implement `bary_A` and `bary_L` to
convert Cartesian coordinates to barycentric using array and list-matrix data
structures respectively.  Since both of these are direct translations of
the above formulas, we relegate them to the [code
appendix](#barycentric-conversions).  We will use them to shade every point of
our triangle with the weighted color of the vertices.

First, the data (defined in the [appendix](#data)):

```{r}
str(point.L)  # every point we want to compute color
vertex.L      # list-matrix!
```

The `vertex.L` list-matrix has the x, y coordinates and the red, green, and blue
color channel vales of the triangle associated with each point.  In this
particular case it happens to be the same triangle for every point, so we could
have used a single instance of the triangle.  The generalization needs to
allow for many triangles with a small and varying number of points per triangle,
and to handle that efficiently in R we need to match each point to its own
triangle.

And the shading function:

```{r v-shade-l}
```

Step 1) is carried out by [`bary_L`](#bary_l), which is a simple adaptation of
the [barycentric conversion formulas](#bary-formula).  Step 2) is the most
complicated.  To understand what's going on we need to look at the two data
inputs to `apply`, which are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
v <- vertex.L
bc <- bary_L(point.L, vertex.L)
clr.raw <- apply(v[, c('r','g','b')], 2, Map, f="*", bc)
```
```{r}
v[, c('r','g','b')]
str(bc)
```
In:
```{r eval=FALSE}
clr.raw <- apply(v[, c('r','g','b')], 2, Map, f="*", bc)
```
We ask `apply` to call `Map` for each column of `v[, c('r','g','b')]`.  The
additional arguments `f='*'` and `bc` are passed on to `Map` such that, for the
first column, the `Map` call is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Map('*', v[,'r'], bc)
```

`v[,'r']` is a list with the red color channel values for each of the three
vertices for each of the points in our data:

```{r}
str(v[,'r'])
```

`bc` is a list of the barycentric coordinates of each point which we will use as
the vertex weights when averaging the vertex colors to point colors:

```{r}
str(bc)
```

The `Map` call is just multiplying each color value by its vertex weight.

`apply` will repeat this over the three color channels giving us the barycentric
coordinate-weighted color channel values for each point:

```{r}
str(clr.raw)
```

Step 3) collapses the weighted values into (r,g,b) triplets for each point:

```{r}
str(lapply(clr.raw, Reduce, f="+"))
```

And with the colors we can render our fully shaded triangle (see appendix for
[`plot_shaded`](#plot_shaded)):

```{r interp-list, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
```

The corresponding function in array format looks very similar to the list one:

```{r bary-matrix}
v_shade_A <- function(p, v) {
  ## 1) compute barycentric coords
  bc <- bary_A(p, v)
  ## 2) for each point, weight vertex colors by bary coords
  v.clrs <- v[,,c('r','g','b')]
  clr.raw <- array(bc, dim=dim(v.clrs)) * v.clrs
  ## 3) for each point-colorchannel, sum the weighted values
  rowSums(aperm(clr.raw, c(1,3,2)), dims=2)
}
```

For a detailed description of what it is doing [see the
appendix](#array-shading).  The take-away for now is that every function in the
array implementation is fast in the sense that all the real work is done in
internal C code.

The data are also similar, although they are in matrix and array format instead
of list and matrix-list:

```{r}
str(point.A)
str(vertex.A)
```

Both shading implementations produce the same result:

```{r}
color.A <- v_shade_A(point.A, vertex.A)
col_eq(color.L, color.A)
```

Yet, the list based shading is substantially faster:

```{r}
microbenchmark(times=25,
  v_shade_L(point.L, vertex.L),
  v_shade_A(point.A, vertex.A)
)
```

We can get a better sense of where the speed differences are coming from by
looking at the profile data using [`treeprof`][2]:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
treeprof(v_shade_L(point.L, vertex.L))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(treeprof(v_shade_L(point.L, vertex.L), target.time=1))
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
treeprof(v_shade_A(point.A, vertex.A))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(treeprof(v_shade_A(point.A, vertex.A), target.time=1))
```

Most of the time difference is in the [`bary_L`](#bary_l) vs [`bary_A`](#bary_a)
functions that compute the barycentric coordinates.  You can also tell that
because almost all the time in the `bary_*` functions is "self" time (the second
column in the profile data) that this time is all spent doing primitive /
internal operations.

Step 2) takes about the same amount of time for both the list-matrix and array
methods (the `apply` call for `v_shade_L` and the `array` call for `v_shade_A`,
but step 3) is also much faster for the list approach because with the
array approach we need to permute the dimensions so we can use `rowSums` (more
details in the [appendix](#array-shading)).

# Conclusion

If your data set is tall and skinny, list data structures can improve
performance without compiled code or additional external dependencies.  Most
operations are comparable in speed whether done with matrices or lists, but 
key operations are faster and that make some tasks noticeably more efficient.

One trade-off is that the data manipulation can be more difficult with lists,
but for code in a package the extra work may be justified.  Additionally, this
is not always true: patterns like `do.call(fun, list)` simplify tasks that
can be awkward with matrices.

# Appendix

## Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()

## Column Equality

<a name='col_eq'></a>
```{r col-eq, eval=FALSE}
```

## Barycentric Conversions


<a name='bary_l'></a>
```{r bary-l, eval=FALSE}
```
<a name='bary_a'></a>
```{r bary-a, eval=FALSE}
```

In reality we could narrow some of the performance difference between these two
implementations by avoiding repeated subsets of the same data.  For example,
`v[,3,'y']` is used several times, and we could have saved that subset to
another variable for re-use.

## Plotting

## Array Shading

```

There are two items that may require additional explanation in `v_shade_A`.
First, as part of step 2) we use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
array(bc, dim=dim(v.clrs)) * v.clrs
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
bc <- bary_A(point.A, vertex.A)
v.clrs <- vertex.A[,,c('r','g','b')]
```

Our problem is that we need to multiply the vertex weights in `bc` with the
`v.clrs` color channel values, but they do not conform:

```{r}
dim(bc)
dim(v.clrs)
```

Since we use the same weights for each color channel, it is just a matter of
recycling the `bc` matrix once for each channel.  Also, since the color channel
is the last dimension we can just let `array` recycle the data to fill out the
product of the vertex data dimensions:

```{r}
dim(array(bc, dim=dim(v.clrs)))
```

This is reasonably fast, but not completely ideal since it does mean we need to
allocate a memory chunk the size of `v.clrs`.  Ideally R would internally
recycle the `bc` matrix as it recycles vectors in situations like `matrix(1:4,
2) * 1:2`, but that is not how it is.

The other tricky bit is part of step 3):

```{r eval=FALSE}
rowSums(aperm(clr.raw, c(1,3,2)), dims=2)
```

We ask `rowSums` to preserve the first two dimensions of the array with
`dims=2`.  The other dimensions are collapsed by summing the values that overlap
in the first two.  Unfortunately, we can only specify adjacent dimensions to
preserve with `rowSums`.  As a result we permute the data with `aperm` so that
the point and color channel dimensions can be the first two and thus be
preserved.

There may be clever ways to better structure the data to minimize the number of
copies we make.
