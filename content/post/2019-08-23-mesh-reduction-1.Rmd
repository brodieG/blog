A few months ago a stumbled on Vladimir Agafonkin's ([&commat;mourner][5]) fantastic
[observable notebook][6] on adapting the Right-Triangulated Irregular
Networks (RTIN) algorithm to JavaScript.  The subject matter is interesting and
the exposition superb.  I'll admit I envy the elegance of natively interactive
notebooks.

I almost left it at that, but then the irrepressible "but can we do that in R"
bug in whispered into my ear, once again setting me hopelessly
off-course[^off-course].  Obviously we can do it by porting the code directly,
but the loop heavy nature of it would doom it.  We could also trivially port it
to C and interface that into R, but where's the fun in that?

# Right Triangles

You should look at [&commat;mourner's][5] [notebook][6] or the original [Will Evans et
al. 1997 paper][8] for in-depth details as the point of this post is the
translation to an R idiomatic implementation.  Notwithstanding I can't resist
indulging in some of my newly acquired `rayrender`ing powers for some
illustrations.

The basic idea is to approximate a triangle mesh with fewer triangles while
keeping the approximation error within certain tolerances.  For example here we
approximate the beloved `volcano` mesh (glass) at three increasingly relaxed
tolerance levels:

<!--
Maybe better here would be to have a full resolution version of first level of
approx on volcano, with glass, and then show the increasing levels with the
original glass?  Should we use the full mesh of volcano, or the already
partially reduced one?
-->

<img class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/glass-and-mesh-3-f-merge.png'
/>

If you look closely you'll see that even in the higher fidelity approximation
the wire mesh ends up above or below the glass surface, although on the whole
the approximation is good.

If we flatten the elevation component of the meshes and change our viewpoint it
becomes apparent that all the triangles in the approximation are right angled
isoceles triangles.  This is where the "Right-Triangulated" part of the
algorithm name comes from.

<img class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/batch-4.png'
/>

Another important feature of this mesh approximation is that it is hierarchical.
When we stack the three meshes we can see that each low resolution triangle is
exactly replaced by higher resolution ones when it does not meet the error
tolerance:

<img class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/batch-1.png'
/>

If a triangle too coarse for the desired level of fidelity, it is broken up into
two smaller triangles.  The process is repeated until the approximation error
can be tolerated.

In order to decide whether an approximate is faithful enough we measure the
error between each level of mesh approximation at the middle of
the hypotenuse of each triangle.  For the sake of exposition we will temporarily
abandon volcano and switch to a simple 3x3 elevation surface, and we will show
approximations where at each level every triangle is the same size.

<img class='aligncenter'
  id=three-by-three
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/simple-mesh-s-merge.png'
/>

At the most granular level (gold) there is no error as the mesh corresponds
exactly to the elevation surface.  At the first level of approximation (silver)
error appears around the periphery of the surface as that is where the triangle
edges skip over surface vertices.  We show these errors as a checkered cylinder.
At the coarsest level of approximation (copper) we generate additional error on
the center of the surface and show that too as a checkered cylinder.

Errors are measured at the middle of the hypotenuse of the triangles.  This is
not arbitrary: as we merge triangles together to increase coarseness, the
vertices that are lost correspond to that point of the parent triangle.  An
implication is that we never measure errors from different levels of
approximation at overlapping locations, so we can store the errors in a single
matrix:

<!--
Error matrix, just the cylinders
-->

For clarity the surface was constructed so that all the errors are in the same
direction and directly visible from our observation point.  In practice the
errors can occur on either side of the surface, and we would record their
absolute values.  The corners of the matrix will never have any error as even
the coarsest level of approximation will have vertices at those locations.

We can now compare our recorded errors to different tolerance levels, and use
that to decide what triangles to draw.  A possible algorithm is to draw the
child triangles of any triangle for which its error or the error of any of its
descendants exceeds the threshold.  Here we represent a possible threshold as
the "water" level; errors poking above it must be addressed:

<!--
Error threshold such that worst error in middle and center error trigger.

Image is side by side (left/right):

* Left: error matrix, water level added
* Right: mesh approximation, gold/silver, gold drawn last
-->

Looks great.  Unlike with our original `volcano` meshes we are treating the mesh
color to correspond to a specific level of approximation.  But notice what
happens if we increase the tolerance level:

<!--
Error threshold such that only the worst error triggers

Image is side by side (left/right):

* Left: error matrix, water level added
* Right: mesh approximation, complete mess
-->

Gah, there are gaps!  This is particularly apparent if we try to draw the
approximated surface, rotated here so we can see the gap:

<!--

-->

To resolve this we carry over errors from children triangles to their parents
and override use the largest of the child errors and the parent error as the
parent error.<span id='carry-over-viz'></span>

<!--
Two error matrices:

* Left: original, but with arrows showing errors converging onto parent
* Right: original, but with parent error adding child error stacked on top of it
-->

This ensure that the mesh has no T intersections and as such is
continuous:

<!--
Use same water level as the one that caused the problem before.

# Algorithm in Action

We now have a rough idea of the algorithm.  Unfortunately I learned the hard way
that "a rough idea" is about as useful when refactoring an algorithm as it is to
know that a jar of nitroglycerin is "kinda dangerous" when you're tasked with
transporting it.  In order to safely adapt the algorithm to R we need
full mastery of the details.  I'm still covered in gouges and bruises from the
sharp corner cases and the off-by-who-knows-how-many-errors I smacked into.

The outline of the algorithm is as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (every triangle in mesh) {
  while (searching for triangle vertex coordinates) {
    # ... Compute coordinates of vertices `a`, `b`, and `c` ...
  }
  # ... Compute approximation error at midpoint of `a` and `b` ...
}
```

The `for` loop iterates as many times as there are triangles in the mesh.  In
our [3 x 3 grid](#three-by-three) there are six triangles (4 at the first level
of approximation, and another 2 at the next level).  For each of these
triangles, the `while` loop identifies the vertex coordinates `$(ax,ay)$`,
`$(bx,by)$`, and `$(cx,cy)$`.  This allow us to compute the error at the
midpoint of the hypotenuse.

Let's observe the algorithm find the first triangle to get a sense for how it
works.  We'll use a 5 x 5 grid this time[^min-complex], and regrettably abandon
the 3D realm for the sake of clarity.  The visualization is generated with the
help of [`watcher`][9], and it displays the state of the system _after_ the
evaluation of the highlighted line:

<div id='flipbook1'></div>

When the `while` loop ends the target triangle has been found, shown in yellow.
In the following frames the algorithm computes the location of the midpoint `m`
of the points `a` and `b` (these two always define to the hypotenuse), computes
the approximation error at that point, and records it in the error matrix.

Since this is the most granular approximation level there are no child errors to
propagate[^no-child-error] and the algorithm skips over that part.

What happens next is pretty remarkable.  At the top of the loop we're about to
repeat we have:

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in (nTriangles - 1):0) {
  id <- i + 2L
  # ... rest of code omitted
```

This innocent-seeming reset of `id` will ensure that the rest of the logic
will find the next smallest triangle, and the next after that, and so forth:

<img class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/mesh-anim-4-abreast.png'
/>

At this point we've tiled the whole surface at the lowest approximation level,
but we need to repeat the process for the next approximation level.
"Magically" the smaller initial `id` values lead the `while` loop to exit
earlier, at the next larger triangle size.  Here is another flipbook showing the
search for the second triangle at the next approximation level[^second-triangle]:

<div id='flipbook2'></div>

In the last few frames we can see the error from the children elements (labeled
`lc` and `rc` for "left child" and "right child") carried over into the current
target point.  As we [saw earlier](#carry-over-viz) this ensures there are no
gaps in our final mesh.  Each error point will have errors carried over from up
to four neighboring children.  For the above point the error from the remaining
children is carried over a few hundred steps later:

<img class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-08-23-mesh-reduction-1_files/images/mesh-anim-2-abreast.png'
/>

In this case it the additional child errors are smaller so they do not change
the outcome, but it is worth noting that each hypotenuse midpoint may add up to
four child errors.

Here is the entire process:

# R's Kryptonite

We essentially transliterated the JavaScript algorithm into R.  While this
works, it does so slowly.  Compare the timings of our R function, the JavaScript
version, and finally a [C version](c-version):

```{r echo=FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(Language=c('R', 'JS', 'C'), Time=c(2500,51,7))
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_col(aes(Language, Time)) +
  geom_text(aes(Language, Time, label=Time), vjust=-.5) +
  ylab('Time (ms)') +
  ggtitle('RTIN Error Computation Benchmarks', subtitle='257x257 Grid Size') +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.05, .1)))
```

Our JavaScript timings are in line with those &commat;mourner reports
(~20ms)[^js-timings].
<div style='background-color: red'>
NOTE: on Chrome we're seeing timings start at ~38 and then
eventually drop to and stay at ~20ms.  The timings here are Firefox.  Mesh
extraction on Chrome starts at ~11ms and drops to ~1.5-2ms
</div>

I was surprised by how well JS stacks up relative to C.  Certainly a ~7x gap is
nothing to sneeze at, but I expected it to be bigger given JS is interpreted.
On the other hand R does terribly.  This is expected as R is not designed to run
tight loops on scalar values.  We could take some steps to get the loop to run a
little faster, but not to run fast enough to run real time at scale.

So what are we to do?  Well, as @mdsumner [enthusiastically puts it][7]:

> JavaScript is cool, C++ is cool. But #rstats can vectorize the absolute shit
> out of this. No loops until triangle realization
>
> -- @mdsumner

Indeed, we don't need to watch the [algorithm play out](#mesh-anim) very long to
see that its elegance comes at the expense of computation.  Finding each
triangle requires many steps, and they seem unlikely to be friendly to
microarchitecture optimizations[^branch-predict].

The triangles coordinates do not depend on each other, so it should be possible
calculate them directly based on the grid size.  We cannot completely vectorize
the calculation as we need to iteratively carry over errors across approximation
levels.  Fortunately the level count will be proportional to
`$\log_2(\sqrt{points})$`, so we only need to explicitly loop a few times.

Before we get too deep into this, I'd like to make it clear that vectorizing the
algorithm for use in R is interesting, but also _mostly_ useless.  The
JavaScript version runs plenty fast, and if you must have it in R you can
trivially transliterate the code [into C](#c-transliteration), which can then be
accessed from R.  The vectorization version does have some use as it is not
constrained to `$2^k + 1$` square grids.

So, let's go vectorize the absolute $#!+ out of this.  It'll be easy, they
said.  It'll be fun.  Right.

# Vectorize The Absolute $#!+ Out Of This

I wish I could tell you that I carefully figured out all the intricacies of the
algorithm before I set off on my initial vectorization attempt, that I didn't
waste hours going cross-eyed at triangles poorly drawn on scraps of paper, and
that I didn't produce algorithms which closer inspection showed to be [laughably
incorrect][10].  Instead I'll have to be content with telling you that I did get
this to work eventually.  A victory that had it wasted lives like it wasted my
time would supplant those of Pyrrhus in the history books[^grandiloquence].

While I was generally aware that there is more to the problem than generating
equal sized triangles, I underestimated the degrees of freedom available and
wasted quite a bit of time going in circles as a result.  There are eight
different triangle orientations, split into two groups of four.  The groups
alternate between approximation levels.  Here we show the orientations for the
2nd and 3rd most granular levels of a 9 x 9 grid[^nine-nine].  The triangles
are colored by orientation.  For reasons that will become clearer later we call
the group with diagonal hypotenuses "Square", and the one with
vertical/horizontal ones "Diamond":<span id='sqr-vs-dia'></span>

```
```{r square-vs-diamond, echo=FALSE}
p
do.call(knitr::opts_chunk$set, old.opt)
```

The "Square" triangulation, the one with vertical and horizontal hypotenuses,
has just one tiling pattern.  A particular triangle "shape" (a specific color in
the plot above) must always be arranged in the same way relative to the other
shapes that share the vertex opposite their hypotenuses.  Any other arrangement
would prevent us from fully tiling the grid without breaking up triangles.

On the other hand the "Diamond" triangulation, the one with the diagonal
hypotenuses, has multiple possible tilings:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# should have used the offsets for this, but we hadn't written that yet.
raw1 <- c(03,19,01, 03,19,21, 03,23,21, 03,23,05)
raw2 <- raw1 + rep(c(2,-2), each=length(raw1)/2)
rawc1 <- rep(raw1, 2) + rep(0:1 * 4, each=length(raw1))
rawc2 <- rep(raw2, 2) + rep(0:1 * 4, each=length(raw2))
rawc3 <- rep(raw1[1:6], 4) + rep(0:3 * 2, each=6)
f1 <- c(rawc1, rawc2 + 18, rawc1 + 36, rawc2 + 54)
f2 <- rep(rawc1, 4) + rep(0:3 * 18, each=length(rawc1))
# f3 <- c(matrix(seq_along(err), nrow(err), byrow=TRUE))[f2]
f3 <- rep(rawc3, 4) + rep(0:3 * 18, each=length(rawc3))
tris.f1 <- tris_to_df(f1, err)
nms <- sprintf( "Faux Square %d", 1:3)
tris.f1[['type']] <- nms[1]
tris.f2 <- tris_to_df(f2, err)
tris.f2[['type']] <- nms[2]
tris.f3 <- tris_to_df(f3, err)
tris.f3[['type']] <- nms[3]
tris.f <- rbind(subset(tris, type=='Square'), tris.f1, tris.f2, tris.f3)
tris.f[['type']] <- factor(tris.f[['type']], levels=unique(tris.f[['type']]))

p <- ggplot(tris.f) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=y, group=id, fill=I(color))) +
  geom_point(data=points, aes(x=x, y=y), size=.5, shape=3, color='grey50') +
  facet_wrap(~type, nrow=1) +
  coord_fixed() +
  thm.blnk
pdim <- gtable_dim(ggplotGrob(p))
old.opt <- knitr::opts_chunk$get(c('fig.width', 'fig.height'))
do.call(knitr::opts_chunk$set, list(fig.width=pdim[1], fig.height=pdim[2]))
```
```{r fake-squares, echo=FALSE}
p
```

We show just three alternate tilings, although there are `$2^{16}$`.  All of
them perfectly cover the grid with equal sized triangles.  "Faux Square 1" is
even a pretty convincing replica.  Unfortunately only one of them fits exactly
into the next level of coarseness, "Diamond" [shown previously](#sqr-vs-dia),
seen here in a green outline:

```{r fake-diamonds-outline, echo=FALSE}
bad.1 <- ids_to_df(c(11,13,15,17) + rep(0:3 * 18, each=4), err)
bad.2 <- ids_to_df(c(11,13,15,17) + rep(c(0, 36), each=4), err)
bad.3 <- ids_to_df(c(11,15,31,35) + rep(c(0, 36), each=4), err)
bad.1[['type']] <- factor(nms[1], levels=levels(tris.f[['type']]))
bad.2[['type']] <- factor(nms[2], levels=levels(tris.f[['type']]))
bad.3[['type']] <- factor(nms[3], levels=levels(tris.f[['type']]))

p + geom_polygon(
  data=subset(tris, type=='Diamond', -type),
  aes(x, y, group=id), fill=NA, color='green'
) + geom_point(
  data=rbind(bad.1, bad.2, bad.3), aes(x, y),
  fill='blue', color='grey20', shape=21, size=2
)
do.call(knitr::opts_chunk$set, old.opt)
```

It is only with "Square" that every edge of the parent approximation level
completely overlaps with edges of the child.  Every other arrangement has at
least one parent edge crossing a hypotenuse of a child triangle.  These
crossings are what the blue circles highlight.  Ironically, the best looking
fake is the worst offender.

Herein lies the beauty of [&commat;mourner's][6] implementation; by deriving
child triangles from splitting the parent ones, we guarantee that the child
triangles will conform to the parents.  As I learned painfully no such
guarantees apply when we compute the coordinates directly.

There are many ways to solve this vectorization problem, but the simplest I
could come up with was to treat it as a tiling task.  The idea is to define the
smallest tessellating patterns that extend to the correct layout.  These
patterns can then be repeated as needed in internally vectorized
manner[^int-vec].  This is what they look like for our 9 x 9 example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tris2 <- transform(
  tris,
  alpha=ave(
    seq_along(id), factor(id), FUN=function(i) all(x[i] <= .5 & y[i] <= .5)
  )
)
p <- ggplot(tris2) +
  geom_polygon(
    aes(x=x, y=y, group=id, fill=I(color), alpha=alpha)
  ) +
  geom_point(data=points, aes(x=x, y=y), size=.5, shape=3, color='grey50') +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  scale_alpha_continuous(guide=FALSE) +
  coord_fixed() +
  thm.blnk
pdim <- gtable_dim(ggplotGrob(p))
old.opt <- knitr::opts_chunk$get(c('fig.width', 'fig.height'))
do.call(knitr::opts_chunk$set, list(fig.width=pdim[1], fig.height=pdim[2]))
```
```{r square-vs-diamond-tile, echo=FALSE}
p
do.call(knitr::opts_chunk$set, old.opt)
```

Unfortunately this is insufficient.  We must also for each triangle hypotenuse
midpoint track their children so that we may [carry over](#carry-over-viz) their
errors.  One nice benefit of the tessellating pattern is that if we define the
parent-child relationship for the simple tile, we can copy that relationship
along with the rest of the tile.  In fact, we don't actually care about the
triangles.  What we actually want are the hypotenuses, their midpoints, and the
corresponding child hypotenuse midpoints:

```{r echo=FALSE}
p.dg <- ids_to_df(c(offset.dg[,1,] * 9 + offset.dg[,2,] + 1), matrix(0,9,9))
p.ax <- ids_to_df(c(offset.ax[,1,] * 9 + offset.ax[,2,] + 1), matrix(0,9,9))
p.dg[['type']] <- 'Square'
p.dg[['ptype']] <- 'child'
p.dg[1:4, 'ptype'] <- 'mid'
p.dg[5:12, 'ptype'] <- 'ends'
p.ax[['type']] <- 'Diamond'
p.ax[['ptype']] <- 'child'
p.ax[1:4, 'ptype'] <- 'mid'
p.ax[5:12, 'ptype'] <- 'ends'
p.all <- rbind(p.dg, p.ax)

to_arrows <- function(grp) {
  res <- grp[-1L,]
  res[['xend']] <- grp[1L, 'x']
  res[['yend']] <- grp[1L, 'y']
  x.diff <- res[['xend']] - res[['x']]
  y.diff <- res[['yend']] - res[['y']]
  off <- 5
  res[['xend']] <- res[['xend']] - x.diff / off
  res[['x']] <- res[['x']] + x.diff / off

  res
}

<!--
Add Child -> Parent arrows.

One question: do we add them to all of them alphaed out?  We presumably also
want to show the children and parents in different colors.

solving this problem, but I chose to
focus on the midpoint of the hypotenuses directly rather than on the triangles
proper.  They lie in patterns we can extrapolate without the need to track all
the vertices, and we can compute the position of the child hypotenuses as
relative offsets.  We show the target points in our original "Diamond/Square"
layers:

```{r diamond-square-hypotenuses}
h.di <- c()
```

This simplifies the problem
a little as then we just need to compute the absolute position of a single point
per set of four triangles:

<!--
A square and a diamond, showing the triangles, and showing the centerpoint of
the hypotenuse in red
-->

We can then use offsets relative to those absolute coordinates to get the child
errors to carry over:

<!--
As above, but adding arrows for errors
-->

They key is to figure out the pattern of offsets that gives us the correct set
of absolute coordinates.  The "square" triangles are pretty straightforward as
they have a regular pattern.  The "diamond" triangles are more challenging as
their tiling to offsets from "row" to "row" and "column" to "column":

<!--
Show the midpoints in a 5x5 or 7x7 grid, side by side for each type of point.
-->

Worse, some of the child points end up out of bounds, so we will need to account
for those.

<!--
Midpoints, but with triangles drawn in, and oob triangles highlighted in a
different color.

Maybe this gets merged into the previous plot.

## R Transliteration

This a reasonably close transliteration of the original [&commat;mourner][5]
[implementation][6] of the [RTIN error computation algorithm][8].  In addition
to the conversion to R, I have made some mostly non-semantic changes so that the
code is easier to instrument, and so that the corresponding visualization occurs
more naturally.  In particular, variables are initialized to NA so they won't
plot until set.  This means the corners of the error matrix remain NA as those
are not computed.

This only computes the error.  Separate code is required to extract meshes.

[^off-course]: The beauty is I wasn't going anywhere in particular anyway, so
  why not do this.
[^min-complex]: A 5x5 mesh is the smallest mesh that clearly showcases the
  complexity of the algorithm.
[^no-child-error]: We can split this triangle once again, but at that level
  every point on the elevation map coincides with a vertex so there is no error.
[^second-triangle]: The first triangle is not very interesting because the child
  errors are smaller than the parent error so there is no error to carry over.
[^js-timings]: My processor is clocked at a particularly measly 1.2GHz, so it is
  plausible that [&commat;mourner][5] ran his benchmarks on something clocked
  2x-3x faster.  It seems also likely this algorithm is CPU limited as most
  operations do not involve memory access, and the data set is small enough to
  fit in higher level cache.
[^branch-predict]: In particular it seems unlikely the `while` loop condition
  and the `if` statements therein could be easily predicted by a hardware branch
  predictor, and that's assuming JS code can even be branch predicted.
[^grandiloquence]: If nothing else I feel I've earned the right not to be
  embarrassed by misplaced eructations of grandiloquence.
[^nine-nine]: Some tiling issues become apparent at this size that are less
  obvious at smaller sizes.
[^int-vec]: Internally vectorized operations loop through elements of a vector
  with statically compiled code instead of explicit R loops such as `for`,
  `lapply`.
