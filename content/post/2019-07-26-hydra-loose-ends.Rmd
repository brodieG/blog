Fingers crossed this will be the last post of the Hydra Chronicles, a.k.a.
"Everything You Didn't Want To Know About Group Statistics But Let Me Tell You
Anyway".  Well, it's more of a coda than a real post, a few tidbits that ended
up on the cutting floor from before.

One of our early "discoveries" about group statistics is that if we can compute
the group sum, we can build on that to compute many other group statistics.

Inevitably there were some thing I cut
Right now my plan is to throw in all the couple of random things I ended up
removing from prior posts for the sake of streamlining them, but that I find too
interesting to leave completely unmentioned.

# Rowsums

# colSums

```{r eval=FALSE}
sum_g3 <- function(x, grp, na.rm=TRUE) {
  ord <- order(grp)
  id.ord <- id[ord]
  grp.ord <- grp[ord]
  grp.rle <- rle(grp.ord)
  max.grp <- max(grp.rle[['lengths']])

  # this NA handling doesn't work b/c for na.rm=FALSE you still get NAs

  res <- matrix(NA_real_, ncol=length(grp.rle[['lengths']]), nrow=max.grp)

  # each group that isn't as long as the longest group needs padding

  rle.len <- grp.rle[['lengths']]
  grp.pad <- max.grp - rle.len
  id.raw <- rep(1L, length(x))
  id.raw[(cumsum(rle.len) + 1L)[-length(rle.len)]] <-
    grp.pad[-length(rle.len)] + 1L
  id <- cumsum(id.raw)

  res[id] <- x[ord]
  structure(colSums(res, na.rm=na.rm), groups=grp.rle[['values']])
}
system.time(sum_g3(x, grp))
```
```
   user  system elapsed
  1.186   0.374   1.634
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
  # lens: how long each group is
  # maxlen: longest group
sum_grp2 <- function(x, lens, maxlen, mode='sum') {

  res <- matrix(NA_real_, ncol=length(lens), nrow=maxlen)

  # Generate indices that will map to the correct spots in `res` from `x`,
  # which means add whatever padding we need to the index value for the next
  # column

  len_1 <- lens[-length(lens)]
  grp.pad <- (maxlen + 1L) - len_1
  id.raw <- rep(1L, length(x))
  len_1[1L] <- len_1[1L] + 1L
  id.raw[cumsum(len_1)] <- grp.pad
  id <- cumsum(id.raw)

  # Inject the x values according to these indices that should place each gropu
  # in a column

  res[id] <- x

  if(identical(mode, 'sum')) colSums(res, na.rm=TRUE)
  else if(identical(mode, 'mean')) colMeans(res, na.rm=TRUE)
  else stop("Invalid mode")
}
