# Reverse Polish Notation

[Reverse Polish Notation][4] (RPN henceforth) is an algebraic notation that
orders operands ahead of their operators.  `A + B` becomes `A B +` in RPN.
One advantage of polish notation is that under the assumption that operators are
binary, there is no precedence ambiguity:

```
A + (B * C)    # Normal
A B C * +      # RPN
(A (B C *) +)  # RPN, unnecessary parens for emphasis

(A + B) * C    # Normal
A B + C *      # RPN
((A B +) C *)  # RPN, unnecessary parens for emphasis
```

In RPN as well as standard polish notation, operator-operand grouping is wholly
determined by the order in which they appear in the expression.  This makes it a
easier to enter complex algebraic expressions in calculators with small
displays.  The additional advantage of *reverse* polish notation is every time
we encounter an operator, we can evaluate the operation and keep only the
numeric result instead of storing numbers and operators.  This is probably why
most Hewlett Packard calculators used RPN, including the venerable HP-12C:

Undoubtedly the cognitive load required to understand RPN is substantial. I
remember being baffled when I got my first HP-12C, but once you get the hang of
it there is no going back.  I still reach for my HP-12C when I need to do some
quick calculations rather than type them in finder or at the R prompt.

# Computing on the Language

One of the many remarkable things about R is that you can [compute on the
language][1].  "Language" in this context are unevaluated R expressions of the
type produced by `quote` or `parse`[^quote].  We will use this capability to
convert lists of RPN tokens into standard R expressions.  But before we do so we
need to cover some of the basics.

Normally, when you type an expression into the R command line, it is parsed
and evaluated:

```{r}
6 * 7
```

Parsing converts what would otherwise be a text string into a data structure
that R can interpret as a set of commands.  We can see the result of parsing
by preventing evaluation with `quote`.  This produces "call" objects, which
themselves are "language":

```{r}
exp <- quote(6 * 7)
class(exp)
typeof(exp)
```

The quoted call looks just as we typed it at the terminal, but that is
an artifice of how R chooses to display them.  In effect, the printing of a
call undoes the parsing[^deparse] and returns the call as a string.  We can
reveal the internal list structure[^pair-list] of calls with
`as.list`[^really-list]:

```{r}
str(as.list(exp))
```

The first element of a call is a function or the name of a function, and
subsequent elements the arguments.  In R operators are really functions
disguised as operators, which explains why the `*` shows up as the first element
of the list:

```{r}
class(`*`)
`*`(6, 7)
```

R could have hidden all this language business behind the scenes, but by
exposing it to the user it allows us to do some rather remarkable things:

```{r}
exp
exp[[1]] <- as.name('/')   # Yes, calls are really lists
exp
```

Quoted calls can be evaluated:

```{r}
eval(exp)
```

Big deal, we could have done this with regex, right?  In this specific case we
could have, but generally speaking you need the context of a language
object to properly manipulate it.  Suppose you wanted to replace assignment `=`
symbols with `<-` in the following expression:

```{r}
`x=`=TRUE
if(`x=`) `x=`=c(x="x = \"x =\" y")
`x=`
```

We need to deal with variable names that can contain arbitrary strings, as well
as arbitrary character strings.  I get a headache trying to think of the regex
that would correctly identify which `=` symbols are for assignment, and which
one are not.  Yet this this type of substitution is trivial if you [operate on
the language object][2] directly.

Another mechanism for creating call objects is to use `call` or `as.call` to
assemble them from component pieces:

```{r}
call('/', 378, 9)
as.call(list(as.name('/'), 378, 9))
```

`call` wants the function name in character format; internally it will convert
it to a symbol when it assembles the call.  `as.call` does less input
processing so it requires `as.name` to create the symbol[^fun-as-symb].

```{r}
typeof(as.name('/'))
```

When symbols are evaluated, R looks for that symbol through the search path and
returns the associated object.  In this case it would be the division function
in the base environment.

# Parsing RPN

Why bother with RPN now that we have nice big displays and IDEs with
auto-completing parentheses and lots of memory?  Well, parsing RPN is a great
example of R's language computation capabilities, and that's good enough for me.

First, we need to define a helper function to convert operators in character
format to the their symbol equivalents[^fun-as-symb].

```{r}
chr_to_name <- function(y)
  lapply(y, function(x) if(is.numeric(x)) x else as.name(x))
```

For a single call conversion to normal form consists just of moving the operator
to the front of the call list:

```{r}
tokens <- chr_to_name(list(20, 22, '+'))
str(tokens)
exp <- as.call(tokens[c(3, 1, 2)])
exp
eval(exp)
```

We can generalize the single call conversion by using a stack to build the full
RPN parser:

```{r}
rpn <- function(...) {
  L <- chr_to_name(list(...))
  i <- 1
  while(length(L) >= i) {
    if(is.name(L[[i]])) {
      L[[i]] <- as.call(L[i-c(0, 2, 1)])
      L[i-(1:2)] <- NULL
      i <- i-1
    } else {
      i <- i+1
    }
  }
  L[[1]]
}
```

`L` is both our input list and stack.  The key expression is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
L[[i]] <- as.call(L[i-c(0, 2, 1)])
```

It selects three elements from our stack in relation to our counter `i`,
orders them correctly, converts them into a call, and re-assigns them to the
`L[[i]]` element of our stack.  The rest of the function is essentially
bookkeeping and cleanup.  This should work with any syntactically correct list
of RPN tokens:

```{r}
rpn(20, 22, '+')
rpn(9, 3, '-', 2, 5, '+', '*')
```

In order to get a better sense of what is going on in `rpn` we modified it
with `explain` and recorded the results for you to step through here:

<a name='flipbook'></a>
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source('static/post/2019-01-11-reverse-polish-notation-parsing-in-r_files/explain.R')

writeLines(
  sprintf(
    "<img id='bg-rpn-%d' class='bg-rpn' src='%s' style='display: none' />",
    seq_along(files), files
) )

Part of the reason it is so easy to compute on the language in R is that since
calls are lists, list manipulation facilities can be used on them.  For example,
there is also [recursive solution for parsing RPN](#recursive-solution).

# One More Thing

The `rpn` function is a simple example of what you can do with R's language
computation facilities.  A more interesting example is `explain`, which I wrote
for this blog post.  In the call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
explain(rpn)(9, 3, '-', 2, 5, '+', '*')
```

`explain` modifies `rpn` so that for each step in the evaluation it updates
the debugger view to highlight the corresponding line and show the state of our
stack `L`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
explain(rpn)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
root <- '../../static/script/rpn'
source(file.path(root, 'rpn.R'), keep.source=TRUE)
source(file.path(root, 'explain.R'), keep.source=TRUE)
exp.chr <- capture.output(explain(rpn))
show <- 25
writeLines(
  c(
    head(exp.chr, show),
    paste0(c("... Omitting ", length(exp.chr) - show, " lines."), collapse="")
) )
```

As you can see when comparing to the [original function](#stack-parsing), each
"top-level"[^top-level] call has been modified by adding a call to
`refresh_display`.  This was done with by applying `enmonitor_one` to each of
them:

```{r}
enmonitor_one
```

In R curly braces (`{}`), parentheses (`()`), and assignments (`<-`) are all
calls themselves that like operators are displayed specially when deparsed.
This is also true of control flow elements like `if` and `while`.  This allows
us to add code blocks, parenthesize expressions, and manipulate control
structures.

We also need to line up each call's position in the displayed output, and there
is some work going on behind the scenes that computes the call line number and
provides it to `refresh_display`.  So in `refresh_display(2)`, we are telling
`refresh_display` to highlight the second line in the function source.  You can
see we do this in `enmonitor_one` with `bquote`, which is like `quote`, except
that it allows evaluation of expressions enclosed in `.()`.

If you are interested in the gory details of how `explain` is implemented you
can <a href='/script/rpn/explain.R'>look at the source</a>.  Beware though that
the design philosophy of that code was expediency, not elegance.  It will
almost certainly break with anything other than `rpn`, but it should
be possible to generalize it into a terminal debugger.

The call by call modification of a function is inspired by [Jim Hester's][5]
fantastic [`covr`][6] package, which contains a properly implemented method for
tracing statements in calls.  If you are looking for best practices when doing
this type of ting you will have better luck looking there.
`vignette('how_it_works', package='covr')` is a good starting point.

# Conclusions

It is cute that it is easy to write an RPN parser in R.  It is amazing that
we can write a terminal debugger[^debug-caveat] in R that runs in the same
session it is created in.  R's willingness to freely expose its inner workings
to programmers is one of its under-appreciated features.

```{r child='./../../static/chunks/q-c.Rmd'}
```

# Appendix

## Recursive Solution

There is also a recursive solution with fewer lines of code:

```{r}
rpn2 <- function(...) {
  rpn_rec <- function(tl, hd=list())
    if(length(tl)) {
      hd <- if(is.numeric(tl[[1]])) c(hd, tl[1])
      else c(head(hd, -2), list(as.call(c(tl[1], tail(hd, 2)))))
      Recall(tl[-1], hd)
    } else hd[[1]]
  rpn_rec(chr_to_name(list(...)))
}
rpn2(9, 3, '-', 2, 5, '+', '*')
```

Unfortunately this solution does not lend itself well to a step-through
analysis.  We will not discuss this further other than to point out that since
language objects in R are structured like lists, they are amenable to list
programming techniques.

[^quote]: `quote` produces a single R statement or "call", whereas `parse` produces
  a list of them, possibly of length one.  The lists of calls produced by `parse`
  are called "expression" objects.
[^pair-list]: Pair list really, and even though internally these are stored in a
  manner quite different to the traditional "vector" lists we're used to in R,
  their semantics are very similar when accessed through R.  See this [SO
  answer][3] for more details.
[^fun-as-symb]: You can make calls with `as.call` with string function names,
  and even an anonymous function, but in those cases the language object will
  not rendered as an operator, e.g. `as.call(list('+', 1, 2))` is `"+"(1, 2)`.
[^top-level]: Loosely speaking we consider top-level calls encountered first
  when traversing the function body, except for control loop calls such as `if`
  and `while` which are stepped into.
[^deparse]: Deparsing is the opposite of parsing, whereby a language object is
  converted back to character representation so it can be displayed.  When a
  language object is printed, it is deparsed first so that it looks like code
  one might type rather than a list structure.
[^really-list]: We know from looking at the R internals that calls are really
  stored as (pair) lists.  We agree that `as.list(x)` being "list" is not
  actually  proof that the underlying storage of `x` is a list.
[^debug-caveat]: Granted, we haven't really done that here, but hopefully our
  hacky `rpn` specific debugger is proof-of-concept enough that it can be done.
  Additionally, I suspect (but haven't checked), that the Rstudio debugger is
  implemented in R as well.
