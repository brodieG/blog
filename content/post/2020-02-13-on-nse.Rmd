Non-Standard Evaluation is a pretty controversial topic in R circles, and even
in the R documentation.  Whether you like it never, sometimes, or always, is
neither here nor there.  What matters is that R allows it.  Not many languages
give the programmer the power to implement, use, and abuse Non-Standard
Evaluation ("NSE"), or anything like it.

So what is NSE?  Very roughly, it is to programmatically modify an expression or
its meaning after it is issued but before it is executed.  You can think of an
"expression" an R command you might type at the prompt or in an R
script[^expr-vs-cmd].  For example in:

```{r}
subset(mtcars, hp > 250)
```

`subset` intercepts the expression `hp > 250` before it is run, and changes its 
meaning by allowing the name `hp` to resolve against columns from `mtcars`
instead of just against objects in the workspace.  In other words, `subset`
performs non-standard evaluation on the expression `hp > 250`.

Compare to what happens with an expression that is evaluated in the standard way:

```{r}
mtcars[hp > 250,]
```

We get an error because `hp` is not defined in my workspace.

When we type a simple expression at the R prompt and hit ENTER, R computes its
value (a.k.a. evaluates it):

<div class='bgw-code-float'>
```{r echo=FALSE}
y <- c("am", "I", "why")
z <- c(1, 5, 9, 8)
```
```{r}
w <- c("am", "I", "global")
rev(w)    # reverse the order of `w`
```
</div>

Ironically the process of evaluation in R is mostly about looking things up
rather than computing them.  In our example, when we hit ENTER R first looks for
the named objects in our expression: `rev`, and `w`[^parens].  Lookups are done
through data structures called environments, represented in blue in this
flipbook:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# code to generate flipbook images
library(vetr)
source('static/script/mesh-viz/viz-lib.R')
png.in <- list.files(
  'static/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/templates/anim5',
  full.names=TRUE
)
png.dat <- lapply(png.in, png::readPNG)

png.a <- trim_png(png.dat[1:6], pad=c(10,10))  # flipbook 1
fname <- 'static/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-%03d.png'
lapply(
  seq_along(png.a), function(x) png::writePNG(png.a[[x]], sprintf(fname, x))
)

ids <- 7:13   # flipbook 2
png.a <- trim_png(png.dat[ids], pad=c(10,10))
lapply(
  seq_along(ids), function(x) png::writePNG(png.a[[x]], sprintf(fname, ids[[x]]))
)

ids <- 14:23  # all the others
png.a <- unlist(lapply(
  png.dat[ids], function(x, pad) trim_png(list(x), pad=pad), pad=c(10,10)
), recursive=FALSE)
lapply(
  seq_along(ids), function(x) png::writePNG(png.a[[x]], sprintf(fname, ids[[x]]))
)

```

<div id='flipbook1'></div>

After the lookup `rev(w)` becomes:

```
(function(x) UseMethod("rev"))(c("am", "I", "global"))
```

`rev` is replaced by the definition of the function from the base environment,
and `w` by the character vector from the workspace.  The workspace, also known
as the global environment, is where name -> value mappings created at the
R prompt are kept (e.g. `w <- c("am", "I", "global")`).  Our substituted expression
is a bit weird in appearance, but more useful to R as the names `rev` and `w`
have no inherent meaning.

R is not yet done with our expression.  More on this shortly, but first lets talk
about environments.

# Environments

<span id='env-desc'>Environments are akin to named lists with a few additional
features.  All elements are uniquely named, and the names can be [hashed][25]
for fast lookups.  The name -&gt; object mappings are known as the "Frame" of
the environment.  <span id='enclos'>Environments also carry a link to an
"Enclosing Environment" a.k.a. "Enclosure" (black arrows in the
[flipbook](#flipbook1), pointing to the Enclosure).  The Frame and the link to
the Enclosure together make up the environment.</span></span>

> **WARNING**: Environments have reference semantics.  Be sure you
> understand the [documentation][24] before you attempt to directly modify
> elements in environments, e.g. as in `env$name[3] <- 42`.  We do not write to
> environments here so this isn't important for our discussion, but be wary
> when interacting with them directly.

R searches for a name in an environment's Frame, and if it doesn't find it moves
on to its Enclosure.  Enclosures are environments so they too carry a link to
their own Enclosure.  R repeats the search process until the name is found or it
hits the empty environment, which does not have an Enclosure[^last-env].  We'll
call an environment and the sequence of Enclosures it links to an "Environment
Chain"[^env-chain].

For expressions typed at the prompt the Environment Chain usually starts at the
global environment and links the environments of all the attached
packages[^attached] (represented with the `...` below) through to the base
package.  When searching for `rev`, R will work through this entire
chain and retrieve the `base::rev` function from the base
package[^pathological-pkg].

  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-002.png'
  alt='Retrieving `rev` from the base environment'
/>

When searching for `w` R will find it immediately in the global environment and
stop the search:

  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-004.png'
  alt='Retrieving an object from the global environment'
/>

<span id=eval-env>The first environment in the Environment Chain is called the
"Evaluation Environment"[^env-vs-chain].  When we say that expressions are
"evaluated in" the Evaluation Environment we mean that they are evaluated
according to the Environment Chain that starts with that environment.</span>

When evaluating expressions at the R prompt, the Evaluation Environment is usually
the global environment, so this may all seem moot.  However, expressions can be
issued in different Evaluation Environments, as is the case when they are
part of the body of a function.

# In Functions

After the initial substitution of `rev` and `w` for the function  and its
argument, R will call (i.e "run") the function.  This means repeating the
lookup-and-substitute process on any R expressions contained in the body of the
function[^fun-components], though with some additional wrinkles.

Most functions in R are "closures".  They are so called because they
carry a reference to a "Function Environment"[^fun-env-term] to use as an
Enclosure.  The Function Environment is typically the Evaluation Environment the
function was defined in[^fun-create].  <span id=primitives>Other functions like
the basic arithmetic operators are "primitives".  They are entry points into
statically compiled machine code, and contain no R expressions or
environments[^static-compile-funs].</span>

<span id=fun-eval-env>Each time a closure is called a new environment is
created, enclosed by the **Function** Environment, and with the function
parameter -> value[^promises-actually] mappings as its Frame.  This new
environment becomes the **Evaluation** Environment for the expressions in the
function body:</span>

<div id='flipbook2'></div>

Once the function **Evaluation** Environment is set up (`<rev>` in the
diagram[^env-names]), R can proceed with the [lookup-and-substitute
process](#flipbook1) on the body of the function.  In this case there is just
the one expression `UseMethod("rev")` in the body.

The key observation is that the Environment Chain changed.  It used to start
at the global environment and pass through all the loaded packages (`<...>` in
the diagrams).  Now it starts at `<rev>` and goes directly to the base namespace
environment as that is where `rev` is defined.  Even though the Environment
Chain no longer passes through the global environment, we can still access a
copy of the object referenced by `w` via `x` in `<rev>`[^value-copy].

On the left is the Environment Chain used to evaluate `rev(w)`.  On the right
the one used to evaluate the body of the `rev` function:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-014.png'
  alt='The Environment Chain used for the call to a function compared to the one used for the body of the function'
/>

<span id=calling> `<rev>` is now the Evaluation Environment.  In this context,
the global environment becomes the "Calling Environment", so named because it
was the active Evaluation Environment when `rev` was **called** via the expression
`rev(w)`.</span>

The lookup-and-substitute-and-call-closures process will continue recursively
until we hit [primitive functions](#primitives), at which point actual
computations happen in machine code[^actual-computations].

R's resetting of Environment Chains to be based on the Function Environment
instead of the Calling Environment is known as "Lexical Scope".  The term
reflects that the Environment Chain is based on how the functions were
"written", instead of how they were called.  This scoping mechanism was
inherited by R from Scheme, not from S, as can be seen the [original R
paper][32].

# Masking

It is possible for different environments in a chain to contain the same name.
When this happens the object matched is the one from the first environment along
the chain that contains that name.  Consider what happens if we nest our simple
`rev(x)` expression in a trivial function:

<span id='fun'>
```{r}
fun <- function() {
  w <- c("am", "I", "fun")
  rev(w)
}
```
</span>

When we call `fun()`, R creates a new Evaluation Environment enclosed by the
global environment as that is where `fun` was defined.  We also assign a new
value for `w` in that Evaluation Environment.  The evaluation chain for `rev(w)`
within `fun` is different from `rev(w)` at the prompt:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-015.png'
  alt='How a function environment modifies the environment chain.'
/>

The evaluator finds `w` in the function's evaluation environment instead of the
now-masked `w` in the global environment, and so substitutes a different value
for it:

```{r}
rev(w)
fun()
```

# Non-Standard Evaluation

<img
  id='nse-img'
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/one-2.jpg'
  class='post-inset-image'
/>
One of the simplest NSE functions in R is `with`:

<div class='bgw-code-float'>
```{r}
L <- list(w=c("am", "I", "list"))
with(
  L,
  rev(w)     # same commmand
)
```
</div>

What happened?  `L` was somehow made part of the Environment Chain and the names
in `rev(w)` were matched against it.  `L` masked the name lookup as [`fun`'s
Evaluation Environment did](#fun), except we didn't need to define a function.

While the concept is straightforward the execution is more complicated.
`with` needs mechanisms for interrupting the evaluation, masking the
active Environment Chain in some way with `L`, and resuming evaluation.  R,
being the strange language that it is, provides tools to do all this.

Let's implement a version of `with` at the prompt to see how this might be
done:

```{r}
expr  <- quote(rev(w))   # capture expression
Lenv <- list2env(L)      # convert list to env
eval(expr, envir=Lenv)   # invoke the evaluator
```

`quote` captures a parsed R expression before the evaluator gets to it.  Once
captured the expression no longer self-evaluates at the prompt:

```{r}
expr    # we get expression back, not result of evaluating it
```

It may not seem like much, but it's a big deal R allows this: unevaluated R
expressions can be directly manipulated by R itself.  For now all we care about is
that the evaluation is on hold, but you can do some interesting things with this
as in the [RPN in R post][28].

`list2env` creates a new environment with the Calling Environment (global env
here) as the enclosure.  This is natural because environments are [akin to named
lists](#env-desc).

```{r}
Lenv
ls.str(Lenv)
```
```{r}
parent.env(Lenv)   # parent.env == enclosure
```

`eval` provides a mechanism to resume evaluation while explicitly specifying
an Evaluation Environment:

```{r}
eval(expr, envir=Lenv)
```

This is what the Environment Chain looks like right before substituting the
`w` name[^no-fun]:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-016.png'
  alt='Adding an environment to the Environment Chain with eval.'
/>

By changing the Environment Chain we made the evaluation "Non-Standard".  This
is similar to what functions do, but because we are doing it by interrupting
evaluation and manually setting the Evaluation Environment it becomes
"Non-Standard".

Now look at what happens if we add another environment to the chain with the
`rev` name in it:

```{r}
L2 <- list(rev=toupper)
L2env <- list2env(L2, parent=Lenv)
eval(expr, envir=L2env)
```

We can change the meaning of both functions and values by modifying the
Environment Chain.  We set the enclosure to `L2env` to be `Lenv` with the
`parent` parameter to `list2env`[^par-vs-enc].  We could also have directly
added a `rev` mapping to `Lenv`.

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-017.png'
  alt='We can affect function lookup in our mask environments.'
/>

Manipulating the Environment Chain is not the only way to perform NSE.  Anything
that changes the meaning of an expression after it is issued relative to what would
have happened in standard evaluation is NSE.

# NSE In Functions

Compare:

```{r}
with(L, rev(w))
```

To our hack-at-the-prompt version:

```{r}
expr  <- quote(rev(w))
Lenv <- list2env(L)
eval(expr, envir=Lenv)
```

It would be nice to implement `with` ourselves, but if we try to use `quote`
inside a function to get what someone types in as the argument to that function
we are disappointed:

```{r}
with2 <- function(data, expr) {
  quote(expr)                 # capture expression
  # rest of function will go here later
}
with2(L, rev(w))
```

What we want to quote is the expression supplied as the argument `expr`, not the
name `expr`.  Thankfully R in its infinite flexibility provides a mechanism for
doing this with `substitute`:

```{r}
with2 <- function(data, expr) {
  substitute(expr)
  # rest of function will go here later
}
with2(L, rev(w))
```

When called within a function on a function parameter, `substitute` acts like
`quote` except it substitutes the unevaluated expression passed as the argument.
This allows us to implement `with`:

```{r}
with2 <- function(data, expr) {
  expr2 <- substitute(expr)
  denv <- list2env(data, parent=parent.frame())
  eval(expr2, envir=denv)
}
with2(L, rev(w))
```

We can do a bit better because `eval` supports adding a list-like element to the
Environment Chain out of the box, saving us the `list2env` step:

```{r}
with2 <- function(data, expr) {
  expr2 <- substitute(expr)
  eval(expr2, data, enclos=parent.frame())
}
with2(L, rev(w))
```

`list2env` specifies Enclosures with `parent=`, whereas `eval` does so with
`enclos=`.  This is unfortunately one of those areas where R is not as clear as
it could be about the names of things, and there are closely related concepts
that should be clearly distinguished[^par-vs-enc].

So, what's the `parent.frame()` business?

# Environmental Dichotomy

`substitute` allows us to implement functions that perform NSE on their
arguments.  This is a powerful feature, but with it comes a new class of
potential errors.  Recall that functions create their own Evaluation
Environments, but the expressions that we capture and wish to re-evaluate refer to
names in the [Calling Environment](#calling).  For things to work correctly we
must hand craft an Environment Chain that connects to the Calling
Environment at the correct point.

When `parent.frame()` is called in a function body, it returns the **Calling**
Environment.  `with2` uses `eval` to create an Environment Chain that starts
with our list `L` and with the Calling Environment as the Enclosure:

```{r}
with2 <- function(data, expr) {
  expr2 <- substitute(expr)
  eval(expr2, data, enclos=parent.frame()) #<< Calling Env as Enclosure
}
with2(L, rev(w))
```

Compare to what happens when we don't do this:

```{r}
with2_bad <- function(data, expr) {
  expr2 <- substitute(expr)
  eval(expr2, data)
}
with2_bad(L, rev(w))
```

No problem right?  Except:

```{r}
expr2 <- c("pathological", "I", "am")
with2_bad(L, rev(expr2))
```

Wow, what the heck is that?  Instead of reversing `c("pathological", "I", "am")`
we reversed the expression `rev(expr2)`.  Here is what `with2_bad` effectively did:

```{r}
expr2 <- quote(rev(expr2))
expr2
rev(expr2)
```

It's mind boggling enough that we can reverse an unevaluated R expression,
but imagine you're the user and everything was perfectly fine until the fateful
day you used the `expr2` name in your expression.  On the "Principle of Least
Surprise" scale this outcome is right there with finding a rat in your toilet
bowl.

So what happened?  We had a name clash with the `expr2` symbol that exists both
in `with2_bad`'s **Evaluation** Environment and in the **Calling** Environment.
This is what the Environment Chain looks like when `eval` begins the
lookup-and-substitute process on `rev(expr2)` (`<w2_b>` is `with2_bad`'s
Evaluation Environment):

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-018.png'
  alt='NSE in Evaluation Environment instead of Calling Env is bad.'
/>

When evaluating with `with2_bad` as the enclosure `expr2` resolves to the object
in `with2_bad`, instead to the one in the global environment.

As we saw earlier `with2` bypasses its Evaluation Environment when calling
`eval`:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-019.png'
  alt='Lookups are fixed by setting the Eval Env to be the Calling Env.'
/>

So it works as expected:

```{r}
expr2 <- c("pathological", "I", "am")
with2(L, rev(expr2))
```

There are other ways things go wrong.  Suppose we wanted to use `with2_bad`
inside a function that is careful not to use names used by `with2_bad`:

```{r}
friendly_fun <- function(L) {
  z <- c('hello', 'friend', '!')
  with2_bad(L, paste(c(z, w), collapse=' '))
}
friendly_fun(L)
```

What happened?  Instead of using the `z` in `friendly_fun`'s **Evaluation**
Environment, which in this case is `with2_bad`'s **Calling** Environment, we
used the `z` in the global environment.  Why?  Because the `with2_bad`'s
**Function** Environment, and hence the Enclosure of its **Evaluation**
Environments, is the global environment.  So `friendly_fun`'s Evaluation
Environment (`<ffun>` below) is not part of the Environment Chain:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-020.png'
  alt="Similarly lookups fail if we start looking in with2_bad's Evaluation
  Environment"
/>

Again, this is resolved by explicitly setting the Enclosure in `eval` to the
**Calling** Environment with `parent.frame` as `with2` does:

```{r}
friendly_fun <- function(L) {
  z <- c('hello', 'friend', '!')
  with2(L, paste(c(z, w), collapse=' '))
}
friendly_fun(L)
```

The chain is now as we want it to be:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-021.png'
  alt='Setting the Evaluation Environment to be `friendly_fun`s fixes things.'
/>

# Advanced NSE

Since we can capture user expressions, we can also edit them before we run
them.  For example, suppose we want to write a function to sum things in the
context of a data frame, by group.  It could look something like:

```{r}
mean_call <- function(expr) {
  call <- quote(mean(NULL))
  call[[2L]] <- expr
  call
}
mean_by_grp <- function(data, expr, grp) {
  call_env <- parent.frame()
  grp <- eval(substitute(grp), data, enclos=call_env)
  data <- split(data, grp)
  expr <- mean_call(substitute(expr))
  res <- setNames(numeric(length(data)), names(data))

  for(i in seq_along(data)) {
    res[[i]] <- eval(expr, data[[i]], enclos=call_env)
  }
  res
}
```

`mean_call` takes an unevaluated R expression of the type produced by `quote` or
`substitute` and wraps it in `mean`:

```{r}
expr <- quote(Sepal.Length / Sepal.Width)
expr
mean_call(expr)
```

`mean_by_grp` splits the data into groups and then evaluates the above expression
in the context of those groups:

```{r}
mean_by_grp(iris, Sepal.Length / Sepal.Width, Species)
```

Don't worry too much about the details, the important point is that we're
calling `eval` with `enclos=call_env`.  Previously this ensured everything
worked fine, and it seems to here, but what if:

```{r}
mean <- function(...) stop("Boom")
mean_by_grp(iris, Sepal.Length / Sepal.Width, Species)
```

Normally this problem is obviated by the use of packages and associated
namespaces.  That ensures that when package functions evaluate they resolve
their names without interference from user objects.  But this doesn't work here
because we explicitly bypass the normal Evaluation Environment and request
evaluation in the Calling Environment.

Let's examine the modified expression `mean_call` produces:

<pre><code><span style='background-color: #aaffaa;'>mean</span>(<span
style='background-color: #aaaaff;'>Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width</span>)</code></pre>

The problem is that we need <code style='background-color:
#aaffaa;'>mean</code> to be resolved according to our function's Evaluation
Environment, but <code style='background-color:
#aaaaff;'>Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width</code> to be resolved according to the
Calling Environment.  We can only evaluate an expression in a single
environment, so we're stuck.

We could use `base::mean` instead of `mean`, but this would still fail if
someone redefined `::` in the Calling Environment (and yes, they can).
Another option is to manually substitute the actual function instead of the name
of the function:

<div id=call-assembly>
```{r}
mean_call <- function(expr) {
  call <- quote(NULL(NULL))  # call template
  call[[1L]] <- mean         # actual function object
  call[[2L]] <- expr
  call
}
```
</div>

Let's pretend our functions here are in a hypothetical package `pkg` with no
dependencies.  In that case, this is what the Environment Chain looks like as
`mean_call` is injecting `mean` into the call template (`call`, shown as
`NULL(NULL)`) in the second line of the function[^strained-metaphor]:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-022.png'
  alt='Package functions are immune from interference by objects in the global
  environment'
/>

`<mcll>` is `mean_call`'s Evaluation Environment, and `<pkg>` the package
namespace.  The latter has for enclosure the base namespace, so the
version of `mean` defined in the global environment does not interfere.  We get:

```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(mean)
expr <- quote(Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
```
```{r}
mean_call(expr)
```

This looks ugly, but by pre-resolving `mean` to the correct function we can
safely `eval` the expression in a different Environment Chain:

<img
  src='/post/2020-02-13-on-nse_files/images/flip-1/img-023.png'
  alt='Pre-substituting our function call prior to evaluation allows things to
  resolve correctly'
/>

`<mbg>` is the Evaluation Environment of `mean_by_group`, but that Environment
Chain is bypassed by `eval` to resolve `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, and `/` in
`iris` enclosed by the Calling Environment.

Geez, that was a lot less fun than I thought it was going to be when I started
writing the post.  Trying to keep all those closely related but critically
different concepts distinct while remaining faithful[^mostly-faithful] to the
documentation was exhausting.  I imagine reading through this likely had a
similar effect on you, so if you managed to get this far I'll consider it a
small victory.

Unfortunately even the standard evaluation model in R is complex, so messing
around with it for NSE is even more so.  It is particularly challenging
because in many cases incorrect usage of NSE works fine, but then proceeds to
break in the most bewildering ways under global usage.  Further compounding
things is the challenging terminology (looking at you `parent.env` vs
`parent.frame` vs `environment`).

I do hope that whatever clarity this post might add on the topic is not
terminally muddled by its length.  If you have any feedback I'd be happy to hear
it.

    * [Paul Murrell][54] for [`gridBezier`][51] which I used to turn the SVG into
      a polygon outline.
    * [Michael Sumner][55] for [`decido`][52] which I initially used to triangulate the
      polygons.
    * [Tyler Morgan Wall][56] for [`rayrender`][53] with which I rendered the logos in
      beautiful path-traced glory.
* Simon Urbanek for the [`png`
  package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/png/index.html) which I used
  while post-processing the images used in the flipbooks.

## Updates

* 2020-05-06: `png` acknowledgment.
* 2020-07-15:
    * Changed "command" to "expression" to be more consistent with terminology
      used in R's documentation (h/t Lionel Henry).  A related change was to
      make the example function signatures more consistent with those of base.
    * Added a link to "Advanced R, 1st Edition" to the references (h/t Lionel
      Henry).
    * Removed superflous footnote (h/t Michael Chirico).

[^expr-vs-cmd]: Originally I used "command" throughout the post to avoid
  ambiguity with R's `expression` object, which roughly could be described as a
  list of R commands.  The early drafts of this post switched between
  "expression" and "command", but in the end I settled on "command".  Lionel
  Henry convinced me to switch to "expression" as that is what the R
  documentation uses despite the ambiguity.
[^simple-model]: <span id='simple-model'>Items
  we gloss over include but are not
  limited to:<ul>
  <li>Function parameters are [evaluated lazily][20] so they are only fetched
  when they are referenced within a function body as something other than an
  argument to a closure (e.g. as an argument to a primitive or other entry
  points into statically compiled machine code, or simply as a stand-alone
  reference to the name as in `force`).
  <li>What is fetched is a pointer to the location in memory the R objects are
  stored in, not the objects proper.  Since in R memory addresses are not
  directly visible, we'll treat the pointers as if they are the actual R
  objects they reference.
  <li>The [byte-compiler][21] affects the nature of non-evaluated code
  prefetching the objects names point to and performing other optimizations, and
  generally bypassing many aspects of the "normal" evaluation process.
  <li>Names representing called functions are only resolved against names that
  are associated with functions.
  <li>Lookups from the global environment down are usually done against a
  "global" hash table that replicates the semantics of the Environment Chain,
  but isn't actually a chain.
  <li>The base environment has an enclosure, although it is the empty
  environment which itself does not have an enclosure.
  <li>And more.</ul></span>
[^parens]: The parentheses in `rev(x)` are not considered "names".  They are
  syntax tokens that are used to parse the expression.  Opening parentheses that
  are not part of the syntax of a function call are names, as in `(1 + 2) * 3`.
[^promises-actually]: <span id=promises-actually>In reality instead of the
  values of the arguments, R stores the expression passed as the argument along
  with the environment to evaluate it in.  If the argument is used by the
  function then the expression is evaluated in its environment to produce the
  value.  This is typically the same as if R had used the values directly, but
  there are some circumstances where behavior is changed due to this feature.
  Values that are stored as the expression used to generate them along with the
  environment to evaluate that expression are known as promises</span>
[^pathological-pkg]: Well, it will unless you have loaded a pathological package
  that also defines a `rev` function, or if you yourself define a `rev` function
  in the global environment.
[^fun-env-term]: <span id=fun-env-term>I dislike the term "Function Environment"
  as because there are two environments that could be considered the "function
  environment": the evaluation environment generated each time the function is
  invoked, and the environment to use as its enclosure.  Additionally, "Function
  Environment" suggests the environment belongs to the function.  Strictly
  speaking, what we call the "Function Enclosure" is "environment to use as the
  enclosure for the function evaluation environments".</span>
[^env-vs-chain]: In some contexts the term "environment" is taken to mean the
  entire Environment Chain.  In fact, the term "Environment Chain" is not a term
  used by the R documentation.
[^fun-components]: Functions in R that are defined with the `function` keyword
  (i.e. `fun <- function(<formals>) {<body>}` have three components: formals
  (a.k.a.  parameter list), body (a.k.a. the set of expressions that the function
  executes), and the Function Environment, which I prefer to call the [Function
  Enclosure](#fun-env-term).  See full details in the [R Language
  Definition][31].
[^fun-create]: That is the default behavior, but is possible to change what the
  enclosing environment for any given function's evaluation environments will
  be with `environment(fun) <- `.  See also the discussion of [function
  evaluation environment terminology](#fun-env-term).
[^static-compile-funs]: `.Primitive`, `.Internal`, and a few other special
  R functions are entry points into the statically compiled machine code that
  actually does the work of computation.  Once those functions are invoked there
  is no more R code until they return, except if for some reason the statically
  compiled routines themselves invoke the internal version of `eval` or similar
  to evaluate R code.
[^value-copy]: R only copies objects when necessary to maintain the
  "pass-by-value" illusion.  See ["The Secret Lives Of R Objects"][31] for more
  details.
[^no-fun]: Environments can have multiple children [as we saw
  previously](#rev-chain).  While not shown here `fun`'s environment from
  earlier is still linked to the global environment.
[^par-vs-enc]: Unfortunately the terminology around the hierarchical
  relationship of environments in R is muddled.  In early days the term "parent"
  was used for enclosures, which is why `parent.env` returns the enclosure of an
  environment.  However, there is also the `parent.frame`, which is the
  Calling Environment, i.e. the evaluation environment of the expression that that
  triggered the current evaluation.  Perhaps S's lack of lexical scope
  contributed to this infelicity.  Another oddity is that `environment(fun)`
  is used to retrieve the environment to use as an Enclosure, i.e. _similar_ in
  semantics to `parent.env`.
[^attached]: Packages loaded with `library`, or those that are part of the
  "base" set of packages that are pre-attached by R (e.g. `stats`, etc.), or any
  other environments attached with `attach`.
[^env-names]: We use `<rev>` for clarity; in reality function Evaluation
  Environments don't have names and would be displayed in R as their memory
  address, something like `<environment: 0x7fce5c930238>`.
[^actual-computations]: One of the interesting things about R is that R code
  never modifies or creates objects.  The only effect of running R code is to
  substitute the names for the R objects they point to.  It is only once we
  enter into statically compiled machine code routines that objects are created
  / modified.  This may seem obvious to some, and even though I've always been
  aware of it to some degree, I still find it interesting.
[^strained-metaphor]: The lookup-and-substitute metaphor is a little strained
  here as `[[<-` is a primitive, but please humor me.
[^mostly-faithful]: I'm sure better nitpickers than me will find some spots I
  failed to do this in properly.
[^last-env]: One other possibility is that a chain connects back on itself,
  forming an infinite loop.  This doesn't usually happen unless people are
  messing with environments in a way they shouldn't be.
[^env-chain]: This is not a formal R term.  In the documentation the term
  "environment" is often used as we use Environment Chain here.
