R does a pretty good job of abstracting away the memory management aspect of
programming.  In addition to automatic memory allocation and garbage collection,
R implements a [copy-on-modify][2] optimization that allows multiple variables
to point to the same memory location until one of them is modified.  This defers
and potentially avoids costly memory allocations if the variables are not
modified.

Sooner or later if you are attempting to optimize code you will want better
information as to when and why objects are copied.  `tracemem` can tell us when
the memory underlying an object is copied, but not why.  As of
version 3.5.2 R[^ref-counting] is very conservative about deciding when to copy
objects, so there are many situations where objects are copied when you might
expect they would not be:

<!--
We're not running this code in the expectation that R will be updated and it
will start working without copies, which will look silly
-->
```{r eval=FALSE}
## Under R 3.5.2.
x <- runif(1e4)
tracemem(x)          # tracemem will print to screen when `x` is copied
```
```
[1] "<0x7fcc8a9b7c00>"
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
x[1] <- 0            # no copy
invisible(identity(x))
x[2] <- 0            # tracemem detects copy
```
```
tracemem[0x7fcc8a9b7c00 -> 0x7fcc841cfc00]:
```

Clearly there is only one reference to `x` so it should be safe to modify `x` at
the current memory location without affecting anything else.  In the first
assignment R realizes this and does not copy `x`.  The second assignment leads
to a copy despite the situation being essentially unchanged.  This happens
because out of conservatism R automatically increments the "reference" count any
time an object is passed into a closure.  This marks the object as "could be
referenced elsewhere".  Since as of R3.5.2 reference counts are never decreased,
R has no choice but to assume `x` is possibly referenced and copy it when it is
modified after it has gone through `identity`.

Why did I not just use `invisible(x)`?  Well, `invisible(x)` doesn't actually
increment the "reference" count.  So how do we know when the reference count
changes?  That's where `.Internal(inspect(...))` comes in handy:

```{r echo=FALSE}
insp.chr <- c(
"@7ff100bab000 13 INTSXP g0c7 [NAM(1)] (len=1000, tl=0) 652,814,533,482,12,...",
"@7ff100bab000 13 INTSXP g0c7 [NAM(1)] (len=1000, tl=0) 652,814,533,482,12,...",
"@7ff100bab000 13 INTSXP g0c7 [NAM(3)] (len=1000, tl=0) 652,814,533,482,12,..."
)
insp.chr <- sub("(\\[NAM\\(.\\)\\])", "\033[43m\\1\033[m", insp.chr)
```
<a name=inspect-ex></a>
```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- sample(1e3)
.Internal(inspect(x))
```
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
writeLines(
  paste0(
    "<pre><code>", paste0(fansi::sgr_to_html(insp.chr[1]), collapse="\n"),
    "</code></pre>"
) )
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
invisible(x)
.Internal(inspect(x))
```
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
writeLines(
  paste0(
    "<pre><code>", paste0(fansi::sgr_to_html(insp.chr[2]), collapse="\n"),
    "</code></pre>"
) )
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
invisible(identity(x))
.Internal(inspect(x))
```
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
writeLines(
  paste0(
    "<pre><code>", paste0(fansi::sgr_to_html(insp.chr[3]), collapse="\n"),
    "</code></pre>"
) )
```

We'll breakdown what all this means shortly, but in the meantime notice the
highlighted `[NAM(#)]` bit.  That is the "reference" counter.  `invisible(x)`
did not increment it, but `invisible(identity(x))` did.

# A Note About .Internal, and Some History

`.Internal` is an interface used to call compiled C code routines.  There are
several other interfaces that do similar things, including `.Call` and
`.External`.  Unlike the last two, `.Internal` is not intended for "public use":

<blockquote>
Only true R wizards should even consider using this function, and only R
developers can add to the list of internal functions.
<cite><code>?.Internal</code>, R-core</cite>
</blockquote>

I'm probably more in the Mickey-mouse-in-Fantasia category than "Wizard", but
specifically for `.Internal(inspect(...))`, we only use this as a read-only
operation interactively.  There is also long precedent of actual wizards and
non-wizards using it on the [r-devel][6] [mailing-list][7] [for][8] [just][9]
[this purpose][10] without anyone getting yelled at as far as I can tell, so
it's probably okay.  Don't go putting it in your packages though.

As for documentation and usage guidelines, I could not find anything other than
this informal announcement:

<blockquote>
<p>FWIW inspect is now part of R itself but as an internal function so you can either use it directly via .Internal or for compatibility
<pre><code>inspect <- function(...) .Internal(inspect(...))</code></pre>
<p> the arguments are (x, max.depth=-1, max.elements=5) &#91;the last one is
only supported in R-devel&#93;.

</blockquote>

The chatter around the quote above alludes to an `inspect` package, the only
trace of which I can find is [on Rforge][1].  It does not show up in the CRAN
archives, so perhaps it never made it on there.

This was quietly added at revision 48129 to what was then R under development
2.9.0:

# What Does it All Mean?

## Output Breakdown

Let's break down the output of `.Internal(inspect(x))` from our [earlier
example](#inspect-ex):

```{r eval=FALSE}
.Internal(inspect(x))
```
```
Address          Type Name   Extra               True Length
|                |           |                   |
+-----------+    +----+      +------+            +--+
@7ff100bab000 13 INTSXP g0c7 [NAM(1)] (len=1000, tl=0) 652,814,533,482,12,...
              ++        +--+          +--------+       +--------------------+
              |         |             |                |
              Type      GC Info       Length           Data
```

Additionally, let's look at the breakdown for a character vector as it displays
differently:

```{r eval=FALSE}
.Internal(inspect(letters[1:2]))
```
```
@7fd48ad800c8 16 STRSXP g0c2 [] (len=2, tl=0)
  @7fd48995b920 09 CHARSXP g0c1 [MARK,gp=0x61] [ASCII] [cached] "a"
  @7fd489a7ddb8 09 CHARSXP g0c1 [MARK,gp=0x60] [ASCII] [cached] "b"
```

The first line represents the character vector itself, and looks a lot like the
integer vector.  The next two indented lines represent the vector elements, so
there is one line for "a", and one lien for "b".  Breaking down the "a" line:

<pre></pre>
```
  Address          Type Name    Extra                  Cached
  |                |            |                      |
  +-----------+    +-----+      +------------+         +------+
  @7fd48995b920 09 CHARSXP g0c1 [MARK,gp=0x61] [ASCII] [cached] "a"
                ++         +--+                +-----+          +-+
                |          |                   |                |
                Type       GC Info             Encoding         Data
```

**Note**: What follows is my interpretation of what is in [R internals][15] and
in the sources (r-devel r76003).  I could be wrong about some/all of it, and
what I'm right about could change.  Do not make rash life decisions based on it.

## Address

`7ff100bab000` represents the effective memory location at which the R object
can be found in hexadecimal notation.  There is no legitimate use within R of
the specific memory address of an object that I know of other than to confirm
whether two symbols point to the same underlying R object or not.

One interesting point I only noticed while writing this post is that the address
only uses 48 bits (16^12 == 2^4^12 == 2^48).  It turns out this because current
x86-64 bit processors only [address 48 bits of memory space][11].

## Type and Type Name

In R internals object types are categorized with integer values.  For example,
`NULL` objects are type 0, with type name `NILSXP`, and integer vectors are type
13, with type name `INTSXP`.  Generally the types have corresponding values as
returned by the `typeof` R function although some types like `CHARSXP` are not
typically visible from R.

For a full listing of the types and type names see the [appendix](#appendix) or
the [SEXP section of the R Internals Manual][12].

## Garbage Collection (GC) Info

Software like R that manages memory allocation will be responsible for freeing
previously-allocated-but-no-longer-used memory for re-use.  This process is
known as garbage collection.  R's garbage collector is [generational][13]
meaning that it adjusts collection frequency depending on object age.  The idea
is that "most objects die young"[^die-young] so you can improve garbage
collection performance by first collecting the younger generation.

The  first two characters _partly_ encode the generation of the R object, denoted
by the "g" and then either a 0 or 1 representing the value of the `gcgen` bit
that is part of the R object.  R also uses the [`mark` bit][16] which is
displayed in the next section of the output to track up to three generations of
objects, where objects that have a 1 value for the `mark` bit are considered
older than those that don't.

The next two characters starting with a "c" and followed by a number in 0-7
represent the "node class" of the R object, which appears to be a rough measure
of size:

* `c == 0`: Non-vector nodes (e.g. NULL, pairlists, closures, etc.).
* `0 < c < 6`: Small vectors of size `8 * 2 ^ c` bytes.
* `c == 6`: Vectors with custom allocators (i.e. memory is not managed by R;
  these are rare).
* `c == 7`: Vectors larger than `8 * 2 ^ 5` bytes.

Each of the node classes in 0 through 5 are allocated from memory pages that are
approximately 2,000 or 8,000 bytes[^page-size].  This means that you can request
new objects of those sizes with very small performance penalty until you fill
the page for that class, at which point a new page has to be requested from the
OS.  Large vector allocations are requested directly from the OS.  Custom
allocators will obviously depend on their implementation.

## Extra

A comma separated list of tokens with additional information.  The meanings of
the tokens if they appear follow:

* **OBJ**: Has a "class" attribute.
* **NAM(#)**: The "named" value of the object, a heuristic used to determine
  whether the memory underlying and object needs to be copied if the object is
  modified.  If `# == 0` it will not appear in the `inspect()` output and it is
  safe to modify the memory in-place as there are no references to it.  
  If `# == 1` the memory is referenced by one symbol (variable) and can be
  modified in-place by some primitive functions.  If `# > 1` the memory must be
  copied if it is modified.  Note that constants have `# > 1` so that there
  values cannot be changed[^constants-named].  "named" values on an object can
  only ever be incremented.  This token is mutually exclusive with the "REF"
  token discussed next.
* **REF(#)**: A true reference counter that can be both incremented and
  decremented.  In particular this resolves one of the biggest drawbacks of the
  "named" heuristic: when variables are passed to closure functions their
  "named" value automatically becomes greater than one, requiring copy for any
  modifications that happen later, even though there likely are no references
  remaining after the closure is done evaluating.  This could be implemented as
  early as R3.6.0, and would replace the "named" system.  This token is mutually
  exclusive with the "NAME" token discussed previously.
* **DBG**: (closures only) has been `debug`ged.
* **TR**: (closure only) has been `trace`d.
* **STP**: (closure only) has been `debugonce`d, but once reference counting is
  implemented used to designate that references should not be counted on
  non-closure objects.
* **S4**: Is S4 (also implicit in the "gp" code).
* **AB**: Is an active binding (also implicit in "gp" code), i.e. does typing
  the symbol name trigger an action.
* **LCK**: Is a locked environment (also implicit in "gp" code), e.g. package
  namespaces.
* **gp=0x####**: Hexadecimal, value of the "General Purpose" 16 bit code
  associated with the object.  This is used to encode things such as whether a
  promise has been seen, the encoding of a character string, whether an object
  is S4, and others[^gp].  Some of the values are captured by other tokens.
* **GL**: Is the Global Environment.
* **ATT**: Has attributes.

## Length And True Length

The length of vectors.  For true length:

## Encoding

Can be "bytes", "latin1", "UTF8", or "ASCII".

## Cache

Whether a string is part of the global string hash table.  Should be present for
all end-user facing strings.

## Data

A small snippet of the data.

<blockquote>
<p>
This is almost unused. The only current use is for hash tables of environments (VECSXPs), where length is the size of the table and truelength is the number of primary slots in use, and for the reference hash tables in serialization (VECSXPs), where truelength is the number of slots in use.

[^ref-counting]: Future versions of R will implement more sophisticated
[reference counting][3] that will better detect whether objects truly need to be
copied or not.
[^die-young]: Imagine a script that calls many functions sequentially.  Each of
those calls is likely to generate many internal R objects that are no longer
needed as soon as the function ends evaluation.  Only the return values are
preserved in variables.  These function specific objects are likely to be the
younger generation that is eliminated first.  Preserved objects in variables
will then be aged into an older generation and only be reviewed for freeing if
eliminating the young generation is insufficient.
[^constants-named]: This came up in the [Matt Dowle - Peter Daalgard thread][18].
[^page-size]: There some small overhead for each page, and also some rounding to
multiples of the underlying R object sizes.  Systems with long vector support
(64 bit?) appear to use the 8000 byte base page size.
[^gp]: For a full accounting of the general purpose bits see [R Internals][17].
