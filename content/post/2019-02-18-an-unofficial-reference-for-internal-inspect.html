<p>R does a pretty good job of abstracting away the memory management aspect of
programming. We don’t need to know anything about <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, memory
leaks, illegal access, and other terrible things that can happen when one tries
to manually manage memory.</p>
<p>So why pull back the curtain and peer into the memory internals of R objects?
Under some circumstances there can be important performance implications.</p>
<p>R implements a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15759117/">copy-on-modify</a> optimization that allows multiple variables
to point to the same object / memory location until one of them is modified.
In particular, this prevents copies when variables are passed to functions that
read but do not modify their arguments. If the function were to modify the
argument in the function frame<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, then it would be copied first so that
the reference<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> from the calling frame is not affected. This preserves R’s
call-by-value<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> semantics while only copying objects when needed.</p>
<p>One problem with the copy-on-modify optimization is that as of R3.5.2 it is
based on a very conservative reference counting heuristic<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This
can cause unexpected and/or unnecessary object copies.</p>
<p>We can use <code>tracemem</code> to detect object copies, unexpected or otherwise:</p>
<!--
We're not running this code in the expectation that R will be updated and it
will start working without copies, which will look silly
-->
<pre class="r"><code>## Under R 3.5.2.
x &lt;- sample(10)
tracemem(x)          # tracemem will print to screen when `x` is copied</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;&lt;0x7fcc8a9b7c00&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>c(x)                 # &#39;touch&#39; x, with no changes</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1]  0  2  1  9  3  5  7 10  8  6</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>x[1] &lt;- 0            # no copy</code></pre>
<p>We know the memory referenced by <code>x</code> was not copied despite being modified
because <code>tracemem</code> was quiet. Let’s try again, slightly differently:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>identity(x)          # &#39;touch&#39; again, with more emotion</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1]  0  2  1  9  3  5  7 10  8  6</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>x[2] &lt;- 0            # tracemem detects copy</code></pre>
<pre><code>tracemem[0x7fcc8a9b7c00 -&gt; 0x7fcc841cfc00]:</code></pre>
<p>What we really need is a mechanism to understand why the first assignment
did not lead to a copy, but the second one did. In both cases there
is only one reference to <code>x</code> so it should be safe to modify <code>x</code> without copy.</p>
<p><code>.Internal(inspect(...))</code> allows us to inspect the guts of our R objects:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- sample(10)
.Internal(inspect(x))</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><code>@7fa5826a0008 13 INTSXP g0c4 <span style='background-color: #BBBB00;'>[NAM(1)]</span><span> (len=10, tl=0) 2,5,10,6,8,...</span></code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>c(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1]  2  5 10  6  8  9  4  7  1  3</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(x))</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><code>@7fa5826a0008 13 INTSXP g0c4 <span style='background-color: #BBBB00;'>[NAM(1)]</span><span> (len=10, tl=0) 2,5,10,6,8,...</span></code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>identity(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1]  2  5 10  6  8  9  4  7  1  3</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(x))</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><code>@7fa5826a0008 13 INTSXP g0c4 <span style='background-color: #BBBB00;'>[NAM(3)]</span><span> (len=10, tl=0) 2,5,10,6,8,...</span></code></pre>
<p>If you’re wondering what that gobbledygook is, don’t worry, we’ll explain it in
detail shortly. In essence, it is internal meta data associated with the R
object. For now notice the highlighted <code>[NAM(#)]</code> bit. That is the “reference”
counter. <code>c(x)</code> did not increment it, but <code>identity(x)</code> did<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. <code>x</code>
was copied on the second assignment because by that point the <code>NAM</code> reference
counting heuristic suggests there <em>could</em> be more than one reference to the
object.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a substantive difference between <code>c</code> and <code>identity</code>.
The former is a primitive function, while the latter is a closure function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c</code></pre>
<pre><code>function (...)  .Primitive(&quot;c&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>typeof(identity)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;closure&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Closures always increment the <code>NAM</code> counter because R does not currently track
whether their environment is indeed destroyed on exit, so it assumes there could
possibly still be a reference to the parameter. Primitives are
straight-to-compiled C code functions that have full control of memory and
reference count so they can leave it unchanged when warranted.</p>
<p>And what about <code>.Internal(inspect(...))</code>? It’s the R equivalent of a
speakeasy: undocumented, unpublicized, and as shown here occasionally useful to
know about. Only the cool kids on <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/">r-devel</a> are clued in, and I only know
about it because my older cousin’s college room mate’s brother is one of the
cool kids.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-note-about-.internal-and-some-history" class="section level1">
<h1>A Note About .Internal, and Some History</h1>
<p><code>.Internal</code> is an interface used to call compiled C code routines. There are
several other interfaces that do similar things, including <code>.Primitive</code>, <code>.Call</code>
and <code>.External</code>. Unlike the last two, <code>.Internal</code> is not intended for “public
use”:</p>
<blockquote>
Only true R wizards should even consider using this function, and only R
developers can add to the list of internal functions.
<cite><code>?.Internal</code>, R-core</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m probably more in the Mickey-mouse-in-Fantasia category than “Wizard”, but
specifically for <code>.Internal(inspect(...))</code> in interactive use, there is a
long precedent of actual wizards and non-wizards using it on the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2012-March/063485.html">r-devel</a>
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2018-April/075899.html">mailing-list</a> <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2013-March/066195.html">for</a> <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2013-July/067043.html">just</a> <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-November/062653.html">this purpose</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>inspect</code> internal was quietly added by Simon Urbanek at revision 48129 to
what was then R under development 2.9.0:</p>
<pre><code>$ svn log -r48129
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
<p>The function appears to originally have been part of the <code>inspect</code> package, the
only trace of which I can find is <a href="https://www.rforge.net/inspect/files/">on Rforge</a>. It does not show up in the
CRAN archives, so perhaps it never made it on there. The package does have
<a href="https://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/inspect/inspect.html">some terse documentation</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the only documentation outside of Rforge is this informal announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
FWIW inspect is now part of R itself but as an internal function so you can
either use it directly via .Internal or for compatibility
<pre><code>inspect <- function(...) .Internal(inspect(...))</code></pre>
<p>
the arguments are (x, max.depth=-1, max.elements=5) [the last one is
only supported in R-devel].

<p>All of the information after the address token is object meta data. It is part
of the underlying C-level representation of the R object. We’ll review each
piece of output next.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: What follows is my interpretation of what is in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html">R internals</a> and
in the sources<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. I could be wrong about some or all of it, and what
I’m right about could change in the future. Do not make rash life decisions

<p><code>7fa582fa7248</code> represents the memory location of the R object as a hexadecimal
offset. I know of no legitimate use within R of this number other
than to confirm whether two symbols point to the same R object or not.</p>
<p>One interesting point I only noticed while writing this post is that the address
only uses 12 hexadecimal digits, or 48 bits (<code>$16^{12} = (2^{4})^{12} = 2^{48}$</code>), despite my processor being 64 bit. It turns out this because current
x86-64 bit processors only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Virtual_address_space_details">address 48 bits of memory space</a>.</p>

<p>In R internals object types are integer values. For example, <code>NULL</code> objects are
type 0, with type name <code>NILSXP</code>, and integer vectors are type 13, with type name
<code>INTSXP</code>. Generally the types have corresponding values as returned by the
<code>typeof</code> R function although some types like <code>CHARSXP</code> are not typically visible
from R.</p>

<p>Software like R that manages memory allocation will be responsible for freeing
previously-allocated-but-no-longer-used memory for re-use. This process is
known as garbage collection (GC). R’s garbage collector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC)">generational</a>:
it adjusts collection frequency depending on object age. The idea is that “most
objects die young”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> so you can improve garbage collection performance
by first collecting the younger generation in the hopes that frees up enough
memory to continue without further collection.</p>
<p>The first two highlighted characters <em>partly</em> encode the generation of the R
object. The 0 or 1 following the “g” corresponds to the value of the <code>gcgen</code>
bit of the meta data. Additionally, R uses the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#The-write-barrier"><code>mark</code> bit</a>, and whether it
is set is shown by the “MARK” token appearing as highlighted here. This allows
tracking of up to three generations of objects<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, where objects that
have a 1 value for the <code>mark</code> bit are considered older than those that don’t.</p>
<p>The <code>mark</code> bit is set on an object if at the time the garbage collector runs the
object is referenced by a variable. I ran <code>gc()</code> in the <a href="#inspect-ex">example</a>
so it would show up here.</p>

<p>The next two characters starting with a “c” and followed by a number in 0-7
represent the “node class” of the R object, which appears to be a rough measure
of size:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c == 0</code>: Non-vector nodes (e.g. NULL, pairlists, closures, etc.).</li>
<li><code>0 &lt; c &lt; 6</code>: Small vectors of size up to <code>$8 \times 2 ^ {c - 1}$</code> bytes.</li>
<li><code>c == 6</code>: Vectors with custom allocators<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (rare).</li>
<li><code>c == 7</code>: Vectors larger than <code>$8 \times 2 ^ {c - 1}$</code> bytes (&gt; length 32
logical/integers, &gt; length 16 numerics/character/lists).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the node classes in 0 through 5 are allocated from memory pages that are
approximately 2,000 or 8,000 bytes<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> depending on the system. New
objects can be created from these pages quickly, at least until the page for
that class is filled and a new one needs to be allocated by the OS. Large
vector allocations are requested directly from the OS. Custom allocators will
obviously depend on their implementation.</p>

<p>A comma separated list of sub-tokens with additional information. The meanings
of the sub-tokens if they appear follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OBJ</code>: Has a “class” attribute.</li>
<li><code>NAM(#)</code>: The “named” value of the object, a heuristic used to determine
whether the memory underlying and object needs to be copied if the object is
modified. If <code># == 0</code> it will not appear in the <code>inspect()</code> output and it is
safe to modify the memory in-place as there are no references to it.
If <code># == 1</code> the memory is referenced by one symbol (variable) and can be
modified in-place by some primitive functions. If <code># &gt; 1</code> the memory must be
copied if it is modified. Note that constants have <code># &gt; 1</code> so that there
values cannot be changed<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. “named” values on an object can
only ever be incremented. This token is mutually exclusive with the “REF”
token discussed next.</li>
<li><code>REF(#)</code>: A true reference counter that can be both incremented and
decremented. In particular this resolves one of the biggest drawbacks of the
“named” heuristic: when variables are passed to closure functions their
“named” value automatically becomes greater than one, requiring copy for any
modifications that happen later, even though there likely are no references
remaining after the closure is done evaluating. This could be implemented as
early as R3.6.0, and would replace the “named” system. This token is mutually
exclusive with the “NAM” token discussed previously.</li>
<li><code>DBG</code>: (closures only) has been <code>debug</code>ged.</li>
<li><code>TR</code>: (closure only) has been <code>trace</code>d.</li>
<li><code>STP</code>: (closure only) has been <code>debugonce</code>d, but once full reference counting
is implemented will be used on non-closure objects that reference counting
should be turned off.</li>
<li><code>S4</code>: Is S4 (also implicit in the “gp” code).</li>
<li><code>AB</code>: Is an active binding (also implicit in “gp” code), i.e. does typing
the symbol name trigger an action.</li>
<li><code>LCK</code>: Is a locked environment (also implicit in “gp” code), e.g. package
namespaces.</li>
<li><code>gp=0x####</code>: Hexadecimal, value of the “General Purpose” 16 bit code
associated with the object. This is used to encode things such as whether a
promise has been seen, the encoding of a character string, whether an object
is S4, and others<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Many of the flags that are implied by these codes
also are highlighted by other flags, so in some ways this is redundant except
for the more unusual gp bit combinations.</li>

<p>Aside: the keen-eyed observer might notice that the “general purpose” values are
not the same for “a” (0x61), and for “b” (0x60). 0x60 in hexadecimal is <code>$2^{5} + 2^{6}$</code>, which according to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Rest-of-header">R Internals</a> means the string is in the
global string cache (as it should be) and that it is ASCII encoded. That is
obviously true of both strings. What about the additional <code>$2^{0}$</code> present in
the 0x61, but only for “a”? This is probably related to symbol names (a.k.a.
variable names) of loaded environments, which are hashed for faster
lookup<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. However, because the symbol names are also stored in the
string pool, if you use a string that happens to be associated with a hashed
symbol, it will show up marked in the <code>$2^{0}$</code> general purpose bit:</p>

<h2>ALTREP Token</h2>
<p>As of R3.5.0 R supports alternative representations (ALTREP) of some object
types or states. For example, the <code>:</code> operator generates an ALTREP object
instead of an integer vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(1:1e8))</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><code>@7fef6290dd90 13 INTSXP g0c0 [NAM(3)]  <span style='background-color: #BBBB00;'>1 : 1000000000 (compact)</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of materializing a vector with 100 million sequential integer values, R
just records that a sequence starting at 1 and ending at 1e8 in 1 increments is
implicitly represented by the object. Some functions can take advantage of this
to sequentially or otherwise use the values of the vector without allocating the
memory required to hold it in its entirety<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Another use of ALTREP is storing the sorted and missingness state in a wrapper:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(sort(c(3, 1, 2))))</code></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><code>@7fd29113bd90 14 REALSXP g0c0 [NAM(1)]  <span style='background-color: #BBBB00;'>wrapper [srt=1,no_na=1]</span><span>
  @7fd290e72588 14 REALSXP g0c3 [NAM(3)] (len=3, tl=0) 1,2,3</span></code></pre>
<p>I haven’t looked at the specifics of how this is implemented, but functions that
are ALTREP aware should be able to tell that the vector is sorted and has no NAs
just by consulting the meta data instead of scanning the entire vector.</p>

<div id="inspecting-complex-objects" class="section level1">
<h1>Inspecting Complex Objects</h1>
<p><code>.Internal(inspect(...))</code> will dump out the meta data for recursive objects
recursively. You can control the depth of the recursion with the first
parameter:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(getNamespace(&#39;stats&#39;), max.depth=1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>@7faa651370a8 04 ENVSXP g1c0 [MARK,NAM(3),LCK,gp=0x4000] &lt;namespace:stats&gt;
ENCLOS:
  @7faa6513a688 04 ENVSXP g1c0 [MARK,NAM(3),LCK,gp=0x4000,ATT] &lt;0x7faa6513a688&gt;
  ATTRIB:
    @7faa65136e08 02 LISTSXP g1c0 [MARK] 
HASHTAB:
  @7faa65e51c00 19 VECSXP g1c7 [MARK] (len=1018, tl=720)</code></pre>
<p>Absent the <code>max.depth</code> parameter you would risk substantial screen output.
There are some slight differences in output here from what we have seen before,
primarily from inspect labeling different components of the complex object.</p>
<p>There is also the <code>max.elements</code> parameter, although in order to pass it you
must also pass <code>max.depth</code> as the <code>.Internal</code> call will only match positionally:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.Internal(inspect(as.list(1:1e3), max.depth=-1, max.elements=2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>@7faa67842000 19 VECSXP g0c7 [] (len=1000, tl=0)
  @7faa67836fc8 13 INTSXP g0c1 [] (len=1, tl=0) 1
  @7faa67836f90 13 INTSXP g0c1 [] (len=1, tl=0) 2
  ...</code></pre>
<p>Aside: notice how similar the structure of the vector list above is to the
character vector structure.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I use the term “frame” somewhat loosely to mean the location were
variables reside, and you can use the term to mean “environment”. The “frame”
is the part of the environment that stores the variable names. The global
environment is the default place that variables you create at the R prompt
reside. Functions have their own frames distinct from the global and other
environments. Note that where the variables reside and where the objects they
reference are stored in memory are separable concepts. You can think of
variables as index entries in a book, and the objects as content in the book.
The index is the frame. The book can have many indices.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>When I say an object is referenced, I mean that there is a symbol you
can use to access it. For example, after we run <code>x &lt;- c(42, 24)</code>, the object
<code>c(42, 24)</code> in memory is referenced by the symbol <code>x</code>. If I were to type <code>y &lt;- x</code> then there would be two references to the object, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. If I call
<code>var(x)</code> then there will be an additional reference inside the <code>var</code> function
while it is evaluating.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_reference#Call_by_value">Call-by-value</a> means that the value of arguments
passed to functions is not changed in the frame that calls the function, even if
it is changed in the function frame. Contrast to call-by-reference where any
modifications within the function frame are reflected in the calling frame.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Future versions of R, possibly as early as R3.6.0, will
implement more sophisticated <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2018-September/076760.html">reference counting</a> that will better detect
whether objects truly need to be copied or not.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>For the NAM (named) reference counting heuristic, the amount of
the increment doesn’t matter, only whether it is incremented to be greater than
one or not.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>I looked primarily in <code>src/main/inspect.c</code> and <code>src/main/memory.c</code>
of the r-devel sources at revision 76003 (2019-01-21).<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Imagine a script that calls many functions sequentially. Each of
those calls is likely to generate many internal R objects that are no longer
needed as soon as the function ends evaluation. Only the return values are
preserved in variables. These function specific objects are likely to be the
younger generation that is eliminated first. Preserved objects in variables
will then be aged into an older generation and only be reviewed for freeing if
eliminating the young generation is insufficient.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>As best I can tell the generations are “not marked”, “marked and
gen bit is 0”, “marked and gen bit is 1”. Since the generations are changed by
the garbage collector, and the garbage collector has no reason to preserve any
non-referenced object, it kind of make sense that the distinction between 0 and
1 for the gen bit is meaningless if an object is not also considered marked.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>It is possible to implement custom memory allocators, but in
that case R is no longer responsible for managing the memory.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>There some small overhead for each page, and also some rounding to
multiples of the underlying R object sizes. Systems with long vector support
(64 bit?) appear to use the 8000 byte base page size.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This came up in the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-November/062654.html">Matt Dowle - Peter Daalgard thread</a>.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
