# Call Me Selectively Paranoid

<img
  id='front-img' src='/front-img/favicon.png'
  style='float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;' width='250'
/>

I don't know about you, but I get skeeved out at the thought of submitting my
photos to random websites hawking favicons.  Worse, I'm supposed to download the
converted image onto my computer.  Yuck.  I'll admit, I'm not exactly consistent
about my web hygiene, but as I sat there with my finger hovering over the submit
button to just get the bloody favicon done with, I couldn't do it.

Surely it can't be that difficult to make a favicon.  Besides, figuring out how
to do this felt like a great way to procrastinate from wrestling with the
intransigent CSS in my website.

# What is a Favicon Anyway?

Favicons are thumbnail images that show up on web browser tabs:

<img
  alt='favicon location on webpage'
  src='/images/favicons-from-the-comfort-1.png'
  style='width: 100%; max-width: 719px; display: block; margin: auto' />

Generating them is surprisingly complicated.  There are many formats you can
use, but I settled on [".ico"][1] as it has the benefit of being a single file
and appears to be the most backward compatible[^ico-right-format].
Unfortunately ".ico" is a Windows icon file format of all things, and there is
no out-of-the-box way to generate them on OS X.  Even Photoshop requires a
plug-in to generate them.

The best way I found to do this on OS X is described in [a post by Michael
Argentini][2].  This requires installing [`imagemagick`][4] via Brew or
otherwise, which felt like too much work to make a silly thumbnail.

# R to the Rescue

It turns out that R makes it really easy to install and use `imagemagick` via
the Jeroen Ooms [`magick` package][3]:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(magick)
```

This is particularly straightforward for OS X and Windows as CRAN provides
pre-compiled binaries with everything packaged up.  On Linux you'll need to do
some extra work to compile with the `imagemagick` libraries, or find a
repository of pre-compiled R packages.

First we start with a square image larger than 64 x 64 and resize it to 64, 48,
32, 24, and 16 pixels to the side. I have no idea if this is best
practice, but it is what the [aforementioned post][2] used.  Unfortunately I
don't know how to vectorize the resize operation directly, so I'm resorting to
hackily writing to disk:

```{r}
library(magick)
img.orig <- image_read(rep('~/Downloads/moon/moon-small.png', 5))
sizes <- 8 * c(2, 3, 4, 6, 8)
img.sizes <- sprintf("%dx%d", sizes, sizes)
img.sizes

dir <- tempfile()
dir.create(dir)
files <- file.path(dir, sprintf("moon-%s.png", sizes))

img.resize <- lapply(img.sizes, image_resize, image=img.orig)
invisible(Map(image_write, img.resize, files))
list.files(dir)
```

To confirm this did what we thought:

```{r echo=FALSE}
img.orig <- image_resize(img.orig, "96x96")
```
```{r}
par(mai=numeric(4))
plot(img.orig)
for(img in rev(img.resize)) plot(img, add=TRUE)
```
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
png('moon-favicon-all.png', bg='transparent', width=800, heigh=800)
par(mai=rep(.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot(image_resize(img.orig, "96x96"))
for(img in rev(img.resize)) plot(img, add=TRUE)
dev.off()
```

We can re-read the pngs into our session as a single `magick` object:

```{r}
imgs <- image_read(files)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
imgs
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
invisible(print(imgs))
```

Conversion to ".ico" is trivial:

```{r}
ico <- image_convert(imgs, 'ico')
image_write(ico, '~/Downloads/moon/favicon.ico')
unlink(dir, recursive=TRUE)
```

That's it!  It turns out that on OS X, preview can *read* ".ico" files, so at
the shell `open ~/Downloads/moon/favicon.ico` confirms that indeed the ".ico"
file contains all the thumbnails:

<img
  alt='Proof that favicon file actually has all thumbnails'
  src='/images/favicon-proof.png'
  style='width: 100%; max-width: 700px; display: block; margin: auto; -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222); filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222);' />

In theory if you put this at the top level of your website browsers
will find it and use the ".ico" file as favicons.  My website places them in a
subfolder and provides `<link>` directives in the `<head>` of each page,
although that's just because the theme I use set it up that way[^favico-loc].

# Conclusions

This is not the first time that I've tackled what was shaping up to be an
annoying system problem only to realize R provides a great solution.  Batch
processing text files is another thing I've done, where at first I struggled
with a bash/shell solution before implementing an R solution in
minutes[^shell-comfort].  I'm always amazed at just how much you can do with R.

[^ico-right-format]: There seems to be some debate about whether ".ico" is
actually the right format to use for favicons nowadays.  It worked for me and I
don't care enough to get to the bottom of it, so there you go.
[^favico-loc]: The [canonical source][5] supports using `<link>`.
[^shell-comfort]: I am a lot more comfortable in R than I am on a &star;nix
  shell.
