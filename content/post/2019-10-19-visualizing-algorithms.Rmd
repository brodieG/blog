I recently got caught up trying to port a JavaScript algorithm[^martini] into R.
A direct port would have been straightforward (and slow), but I wanted to
vectorize it.  I had a rough idea what the algorithm did from the description
and from the code, but because I did not understand the semantics _exactly_
I wasted a lot of time on bad implementations.  It wasn't until I buckled up and
figured out how to step through the JS version in my browser console and
painstakingly recorded what was happening that I finally got things right.

Even though I resolved the issue the experience left me wanting for a better way
of visualizing algorithms in action.

# Instrumenting R Functions

One of R's lesser known super-powers is its ability to manipulate unevaluated R
code.  We used this to instrument an R RPN parser, which in turn allowed us
to [visualize it in action][1].  Unfortunately the instrumentation was specific
to that function, and generalizing it for use with the R translation of the JS
algorithm felt like too much work.

How does instrumentation work?  The basic concept is to modify each top-level
statement to trigger a side effect.  For example if we start with:

```{r}
f0 <- function() {
  1 + 1
}
f0()
```

With [some language manipulation](#adding-side-effects) we can get:

```{r}
f1 <- function() {
  {
    message("I'm a side effect")
    1 + 1
  }
}
f1()
```

The functions produce the same result, but the second one triggers a side
effect.  In this case the side effect is to issue a message, but we could have
instead recorded variable values.  In other words, the side effect is the
instrumentation.  I first saw this concept in [Jim Hester's][2] wonderful
[`covr`][3] package where it is used to measure test code coverage.

Of course only _after_ my need for a generalized instrumentation tool passed, I
got the irrepressible urge to write one.  So I quickly threw something together
into the [`watcher` package][5].  It's experimental, limited[^not-recursive],
but does just enough for my purposes.

`watcher` ships with an implementation of the [insertion sort algorithm][4] for
demonstration purposes:

```{r}
library(watcher) # you'll need to install from github for this
insert_sort
```

We can use `watcher::watch` to transmogrify `insert_sort` into its instrumented
cousin [`insert_sort_w`](#instrumented-insertion-sort):

```{r}
insert_sort_w <- watch(insert_sort, c('i', 'j', 'x'))
```

This new function works exactly like the original, except that the values of the
specified variables are recorded at each evaluation step and attached to the
result as an attribute:

```{r}
set.seed(1220)
x <- runif(10)
x
insert_sort(x)
all.equal(insert_sort(x), insert_sort_w(x), check.attributes=FALSE)
```

We can retrieve the recorded data from the "watch.data" attribute:

```{r}
dat <- attr(insert_sort_w(x), 'watch.data')
str(dat[1:2])  # show first two steps
```

`watcher::simplify_data` combines values across steps into more accessible
structures.  For example, scalars are turned into vectors with one element
per step:

```{r}
dat.s <- simplify_data(dat)
head(dat.s[['.scalar']])
```

`.id` represents the evaluation step, and `.line` the corresponding line number
from the function.

# Visualizing Algorithms

`watcher` provides all the _data_ we need to visualize the algorithm, but
unfortunately that is as far as it goes.  Actual visualization requires a human
to map values to aesthetics.  For example, here we render the values of
`x` as the height of 3D glass bars.  Certainly we all know that 3D bar charts
are bad, but 3D bar charts made of ray-traced dielectrics?  Surely there can be
nothing better!

</video>

If you would rather mine bitcoin[^bitcoin] with your CPU cycles we can settle
for a 2D flipbook.  From a pedagogical standpoint this is probably a more
effective visualization, if a bit flat in comparison:

<div id='flipbook1' class=bgw-wide-window></div>
```{r child='../../static/script/_lib/flipbook/flipbook.Rmd', results='asis'}
```
<script type='text/javascript'>
new BgFlipBook({
  targetId: 'flipbook1',
  imgDir: "/post/2019-10-19-visualizing-algorithms_files/images/sort-anim/",
  imgEnd: 75,  fps: 4, loop: true
})
</script>

If we're content with just the right hand side of the boring 2D visualization it
is pretty easy to create that:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Extract x data and augment with the corresponding scalar `j` loop index

xs <- dat.s[['x']]
xs <- transform(
  xs, j=dat.s[['.scalar']][['j']][.id], ix=rep_len(seq_along(x), length(val))
)
# Data for labels

labs <- reshape2::melt(dat.s[['.scalar']][c('.id', 'i', 'j')], id.var='.id')

# Plot!

library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(xs, aes(x=ix, y=val)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=I(ifelse(!is.na(j) & ix==j, 'red', 'grey35')))) +
  geom_label(
    data=labs, aes(x=value, label=variable, y=-0.25 + (variable=='j') * .125)
  ) +
  gganimate::transition_manual(.id)
```

This will produce an approximation of the right hand side of the flipbook
(showing frame 50 here):

<img
  class='aligncenter'
  src='/post/2019-10-19-visualizing-algorithms_files/images/sort-2d-simple.png'
  alt='Minimal visualization of step 50 of the insert_sort call'
/>

But things get tricky beyond that.  Juxtaposing the code is challenging and
would benefit from some tools to render the text and graphics independently.  My
own `ggplot` implementation requires [horrid text positioning hacks][9].

Transitioning to the [ray-traced version][10] was relatively
easy[^relative-ease] thanks to the surprisingly full-featured and all-around
awesome [`rayrender`][7] package by [Tyler Morgan Wall][8].  I did have to
deploy my rendering farm[^render-farm] though.

# Conclusions

I'm unsure if `watcher` does enough to make visualizing algorithms more
generally practical.  Perhaps automated handling of the code rendering and
juxtaposition would make this easy enough to be worth the trouble.  On the
flipside, as algorithms become more complex figuring out aesthetic mappings that
intuitively represent them becomes increasingly difficult.  Finally, while R
provides some great tools for instrumenting and visualizing algorithms, the
static nature of the output limits the possibilities for interactive
visualizations.

## Adding Side Effects

So how do we turn `1 + 1` into the version with the `message` side effect call?
First, we create an unevaluated language template in which we can insert the
original expressions:

```{r}
template <- call('{', quote(message("I'm a side effect")), NULL)
template
```

We then apply this template to the body of the function:

```{r}
f1 <- f0
template[[3]] <- body(f1)[[2]]
body(f1)[[2]] <- template
f1
```

Our example function only has one line of code, but with a loop we could have
just as easily modified every line of any function[^ctrl].

## Instrumented Insertion Sort

```{r}
insert_sort_w
```

## Session Info

```{r eval=FALSE}
sessionInfo()

[^not-recursive]: In particular recursive calls and not all control structures
  are supported .  It should not be too difficult to add support for them, but
  it was not necessary for the algorithm I was working on.
[^ctrl]: Control statements such as `if`, `for`, etc. do require some additional
  work.
[^martini]: Vladimir Agafonkin's [adaptation of the RTIN algorithm][6].
[^bitcoin]: Now that I think about it...  Hey, Tyler, I have a business proposal
  for you &#x1f92a;...
[^relative-ease]: Well, relatively.  Obviously I had to compute positions
  manually and generally figure out how to use `rayrender`, but I spent less
  time getting up to the hi-res render batch run than I did completing the
  ggplot2 version with the code juxtaposed.
[^render-farm]: I had to retrieve my old 2012 11" Macbook Air to supplement my
  2016 12" Macbook and manually split the frame batch across the two.  Four
  physical cores baby!  Interestingly the 2012 machine renders substantially
  faster.  Clock speed rules sometimes; even though the 2016 machine is using a
  processor three generations newer, it is clocked at 1.2GHz vs 2.0 for the 2012
  one.  I guess it's the price of not having a fan.
